  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**Oxfam GB is rated as More information needed (promising) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- Oxfam GB, a member of the international confederation Oxfam, is working towards a world without poverty. They do this via their humanitarian, development, and campaigning work.\n- Examples of the range of work undertaken include helping deliver clean water and sanitation to people affected by extreme weather events, projects aimed at increasing household income and empowering women, and supporting a legal case against the UK Government’s arms sales to Saudi Arabia\n- Taking figures based on their 2019/20 annual report at face value, Oxfam GB appear to spend an average of around £27 per beneficiary. For their humanitarian programmes this figure is around £16, and for their development work this is around £90. However, we anticipate that the true costs are somewhat higher, given that Oxfam GB collaborate with other organisations on various projects. There is also uncertainty around how outcomes and costs are accounted for across the Oxfam confederation.\n- Because of the nature of their work, and these relatively low average costs per beneficiary, it seems possible that Oxfam GB achieves an impact that matches or exceeds SoGive’s Gold Standard.\n- However, as well as a better understanding of the true costs involved, we need more information about the outcomes achieved by their programmes - such as the typical impact on health and poverty -  before we can be confident that these low costs per beneficiary represent good value for money.\n\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n\n**More about what Oxfam GB does - how they spend your donations**\n\nOxfam GB works within the international confederation Oxfam, a global network of 20 affiliates working in 66 countries. In the financial year 2019/20, Oxfam GB reached approximately 11.3m people from 26 countries with a total expenditure on donor-funded charitable activities of about £307m, according to their [annual report](https://www.oxfam.org.uk/documents/264/Oxfam_GB_Annual_Report_2020.pdf) (AR). While Oxfam’s initiatives all ultimately target poverty, the charity looks at areas such as women’s empowerment, sustainable water, resilience to the effects of climate change, and more (AR p.16).\n\nOxfam GB state they help people overcome poverty in three ways (AR p. 10):\n- Humanitarian: Save lives and help people cope in emergencies such as natural catastrophes. \n- Development: Working long-term to beat poverty for good, for example through construction of water points and social norms interventions to improve the wellbeing of women and girls. \n- Campaigning: Tackling the injustices that keep people poor. \n\n*Humanitarian relief programmes*\n\nFirst, in their Humanitarian relief programmes, Oxfam seeks to enhance the quality of life for people living in poverty and people facing humanitarian crises such as extreme weather, wars such as in Yemen, or outbreaks of Covid-19 or Ebola. Examples of direct measures include providing clean water, beds, or hot meals. Other measures include infrastructure support, such as providing payment options through mobile phones to buy food. \n\nOverall, Oxfam GB reached 9.6 million people with humanitarian assistance in 2020 (AR p. 18). This area consumed about half of their cost of charitable activities. This is equivalent to an annual expenditure (excluding trading costs) of about £152m.\n\n*Development programmes*\n\nSecond, in their Development programmes, Oxfam aims to provide support for sustainable change that addresses the roots of poverty. They put gender justice at the heart of these programmes, working with women living in poverty to understand their needs and the multitude of changes that need to take place to help them. Examples include the construction and repair of water points, distribution of time and labour-saving equipment, community support, and projects aimed at increasing household income.\n\nIn 2020, Oxfam GB state they helped to improve the lives of 1.6 million people in the long term through their development programmes. These programmes made up about another 47% of Oxfam GB’s relevant annual expenditure. This corresponds to about £144m.\n\n*Campaigning programmes*\n\nThird, in their Campaigning programmes, Oxfam addresses what they view as the important structural causes of poverty. Oxfam sets out to secure impact at scale for people living in poverty through campaigning as well as government and business advocacy. Recent campaigns include lobbying UK Parliament to seriously and ambitiously respond to climate change, supporting a legal case against the UK Government’s arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and advocating for the rights of workers in supermarket supply chains. Their campaigning programmes receive significantly less funding than the other two, under 4% of Oxfam GB’s annual expenditure in 2020.\n\nWe note that Oxfam undertakes regular impact evaluations (effectiveness reviews) that are accessible through their [website](https://policy-practice.oxfam.org/series/effectiveness-reviews/). These evaluations follow a defined process called the [Strategic Evidence Framework](https://policy-practice.oxfam.org/accountability-transparency/) that randomly selects a small number of projects every year. The process also defines how results are rated and prescribes a management response that documents key learnings. We believe Oxfam deserves credit for undertaking regular and in-depth impact evaluations, as this is rather atypical across the charity sector.\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Oxfam GB compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nTo review the work of Oxfam GB under the two-question method, we analyse costs per output and compare this to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £50 to double someone’s consumption (spending) for one year) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar)\n\nFor 2020, Oxfam GB state they have helped 11.3m people to fight poverty right now and beat it in the long term. This includes 9.6m people affected by conflict and disaster who were given \"life-saving assistance\", as well as improving the lives of 1.6m people in the long term.  Oxfam also performed campaigning work, which is not counted in the 11.3m people reached. \n\nTaking the 11.3m people figure at face value, this gives an average cost of around £27 per person reached for providing what Oxfam GB describe as \"life-changing\" support. Oxfam GB describes the majority of the interventions as life-saving in the introduction of the annual report (AR p.2), but elsewhere (p. 18) refers to people as \"being helped through humanitarian work\", which suggests quite a range of possible positive interventions. We note that the annual report clearly states that Oxfam GB - not the Oxfam confederation as a whole - reached the stated 11.3m people. However, it is not immediately obvious how global cooperation between the 20 Oxfam affiliates (country organisations) works and how charitable outcomes are accounted for. Furthermore, Oxfam also collaborate on some projects with other organisations. This implies the true cost per person reached is somewhat higher than £27.\n\nLooking at the two main areas of activity individually, we find the following:\n- In humanitarian aid, £152m was used to reach 9.6m people in 2020, so the average cost per person reached is less than £16.\n- In development programmes, £144m was used to reach 1.6m people in 2020, so the average cost per person reached is about £90.\n\nAs above, similar caveats apply to these figures. \n\nGiven the low costs per person reached, and the fact that some of their interventions are in areas such as disaster relief, extreme poverty, and the provision of clean water, which could potentially have significantly life-improving or even life-saving outcomes, it seems possible that Oxfam GB could achieve an impact that matches or exceeds SoGive’s Gold Standard. To reach a firm assessment, the following further information is required:\n\n- Robust evidence indicating the average effect on people reached by Oxfam’s charitable initiatives. While we recognise Oxfam have a process for undertaking and publishing impact evaluations of different programmes, there does not appear to be a regular report that summarises the findings of these impact evaluations as a whole, or that sets out key information (such as costs, number of people reached, estimated impact) about programmes, including those that have not been evaluated in detail. This means it is not clear how representative the evaluated programmes actually are of Oxfam’s work as a whole.\n- Furthermore, we would want to explore the quality of evidence obtained by Oxfam in their impact evaluations and would assess whether we believed the programme or project was effective. This means reviewing whether a project has achieved the goals which Oxfam claims are relevant for that project, e.g. higher income for the beneficiaries, improved health outcomes, or improved gender justice. We would then consider the methodology Oxfam used to evaluate the project, and decide whether it is sufficiently robust to support any claims about the project’s true impact. This could involve establishing whether the project was implemented on the basis of previously-obtained robust evidence and reasoning found in the wider literature, or Oxfam undertaking a high-quality assessment for themselves, such as a randomised controlled trial.\n- Information regarding how charitable outcomes and costs are accounted across country organisations such as Oxfam GB and Oxfam Germany according to their roles as Executive and Partner Affiliates within the wider Oxfam confederation. How outcomes and costs are accounted for could substantially change the estimated cost-per-person reached by Oxfam GB.\n- Relatedly, and as already noted, we would need a clearer picture of the extent of partnership working with other NGOs and the costs incurred by these collaborating partners, as this could mean the true costs per person reached are somewhat higher (i.e. if there are costs incurred by both Oxfam and any partners)\n- Some indication of Oxfam\u0027s strategy. This is because the information about cost-effectiveness discussed in this overview of Oxfam is based on their past activities. While this will often be a good indication of what a charity’s future activities will look like, sometimes a charity will change what they are focusing on, meaning that additional donations could be more or less cost-effective than the average past donation.\n- A fuller analysis would also assess management capability. For example, this would involve assessing Oxfam\u0027s capabilities around Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (or MEL) to ensure that they are learning from their mistakes (and not simply publishing evaluation reports that don’t change anything), and also understanding how the leadership sets strategy and selects projects; in particular, how the charity incorporates cost-effectiveness thinking into its strategic decisions. \n- We note that we had a meeting with Oxfam’s management in 2018. They indicated that work in intractable areas is strategic for them. While this has the advantage of not being crowded with other actors, it has the disadvantage of higher probability of failure and lower cost-effectiveness. We believe that this strategy is reasonable if it were believed that other more cost-effective options (such as malaria nets) were already so crowded that there was no more room for more funding. However we at SoGive do not believe this, and nor do Oxfam. We have not established whether Oxfam’s management still take this strategic approach as of August 2021.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Oxfam GB as \"More info needed (promising)\" under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do have some indication of cost-effectiveness, and see the possibility that cost-effectiveness matches or exceeds the Gold Standard, but this depends on further data and analysis.\n",
