The logic for saying that the opera-goers are beneficiaries is that they would not have been able to see the opera live at the ENO without the subsidy that comes from the charitable donations. However for the opera on the radio, listeners do still have the opportunity to listen to the opera on the radio, even if the ENO had not done this work. Admittedly, they might not have gotten to hear that particular production of that particular opera, but this starts to seem like splitting hairs.",
