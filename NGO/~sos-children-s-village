  "description": "At SOS Children?s Villages, they know that a stable family upbringing with supportive parenting is a key determinant for doing well in later life. That?s why they uniquely place family life at the heart of everything they do.\n\nThrough their programmes, they strive to ensure children across the globe grow up in a loving family within a supportive community. SOS Children\u0027s Villages facilitate access to quality healthcare and education ?and safety in the face of emergency and natural disaster.\n\nTheir approach is working; over the last 66 years, they have empowered generations of children to achieve emotional and economic independence. SOS Children\u0027s Villages seen them flourish and find their feet as adults equipped to nurture their own families, and ?transform their own communities, from within.",
  "recommendation": "**Under the SoGive methodology SOS Children’s Village receives a tentative rating of bronze**\n\nSOS Children’s Villages is the world\u0027s largest charity working with orphaned and abandoned children. Through their programmes, they help children to find education, healthcare, loving families, and a supportive community. SOS Children\u0027s Villages also facilitates access to quality healthcare, safety services, and education in the face of emergencies and natural disasters.\n\nUnder the SoGive two question method, we consider these questions:\nHow much does it cost for the charity to do something?\nWhat is the thing (or, what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)\n\n**Costs**\nIn 2018 SOS Children’s Villages had an expenditure of approximately 1.12 billion pounds.\n\nThis includes:\n£522 million on providing care to \n45,500 children in children living in SOS children\u0027s villages,\n24,400 children through youth programs, and\n3,900 child and adult members of foster families and transit homes \nWith an average cost of £7000 per child receiving service from any of these care services.\n£105 million to educate\n18,300 young adults and youth with specialist vocational training (leaving with a certificate or a recognised diploma),\n98,000 children with primary or secondary schooling, and\n23,400 children with kindergarten\nAt an average cost of £750 per child educated in any program.\n£10 million on providing services to\n126,000 people through SOS children\u0027s social centers at the cost of  £90 per person.\n£115 million on\nSupporting 98,000 families (496,300 individuals) in staying together through family strengthening programs at the cost of the cost of £250 per individual family member\n£8 million on providing \n698,200 people reached through a single instance of health service at a cost of £12 per person.\n£13 million on \nDelivering single emergency response services to 1,178,158 at a cost of £11 per person.\n\n**Benchmarking**\nTo receive a Gold ranking, a charity must demonstrate that it is highly impactful not just overall, but per pound donated (e.g. averting one year of severe depression for £100 or doubling someone’s consumption for a year for £30), and it must provide robust evidence of effectiveness of its work. \n\nThrough its programs, SOS Children’s Villages aims to break the cycle of poverty by providing support which increases children’s likelihood of achieving financial independence and improves their general wellbeing as adults. We consider the extent to which the charity may be able to achieve this.\n\nIn 2018, the charity provided education at the cost of £750 per child or young adult. For £7000, SOS Children’s Villages was able to house and care for a child for the year. Assuming caring for a child is able to double (or further multiply) their consumption when in the care of SOS Children’s Villages and avert a year of psychological harm equivalent to severe depression, the cost of £7000 falls short of SoGive’s gold standard benchmark for both these values. With respect to education, more detailed information about the type of education provided would be needed to equate education with either of these benchmarks.  \n\nAdditionally, we calculate that it costs £250 for one individual to benefit from SOS Children’s family strengthening programs. Keeping families together, reuniting families, or caring for children without families may provide enormous psychological benefits for children, and increase their likelihood of becoming financially independent for a very low cost. If we believe the effects of the charity’s family strengthening programs are twice as good as curing severe depression for one year, it is possible they meet SoGive’s gold standard benchmark. Because family strengthening may lead to lasting effects over many years, the family strengthening program may achieve the SoGive gold standard, if we had sufficient evidence of strong enough impact. Our as-yet superficial review of this area of work suggests that there are few organisations focusing on family strengthening programs. If this is the case, SOS Children’s Villages may also be providing a service which, if not offered by them, might not otherwise be available.\n\n**Conclusion**\nUnder the SoGive two question method SOS Children’s Villages receives a tentative rating of bronze. This means that SOS Children’s Villages likely meets the level of a bronze charity, and may out perform a bronze ranked charity, but we would need more information to be sure. \n\nIt appears that SOS Children’s Villages increases consumption and improves the psychological health of children at a low cost. SOS Children’s Villages may create a substantial and positive impact on the children and families it serves. Through its family strengthening programs especially, an area which few organisations address, SOS Children’s Villages provides a service which may otherwise be absent. With respect to the charity’s educational or housing services, it seems possible that other public or private organisations would provide these services in absence of the charity.\n\nIn order for us to apply a firmer rating, or to potentially raise SOS Children’s Villages’ rating, we would need more information about the impact achieved by their programmes. Specifically, we would need to know what are outcomes they are trying to achieve with their programmes: for example, is the education work intended to help children achieve more income in later life, and/or some other outcomes? We would then need evidence about the extent to which those outcomes are being achieved. For example, we would need high quality evidence about the extent to which education causes children to have a higher income than they would otherwise have had. Such evaluations would need to factor in \"additionality\" or, in other words, would need to consider what would have happened if SOS Children’s Villages were not there to do their work.\n",

  "stories": "???In Zambia, a critical shortage of trained health professionals and a lack of medical facilities have resulted in a desperate situation for many children and their families. With only one doctor for every 14,000 people, it?s no surprise one in 12 children in Zambia does? ?not live to see their fifth birthday.\n\nThe biggest killers of young children in Zambia are pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria and measles ? all of which are preventable or can be effectively treated at a low cost. But in the remote Zambian province of Chipata, people may have to walk many miles for medical treatment. Studies show that mortality rates among young children are 50% higher in places where health clinics are at least a four-hour walk away compared with places where a facility is located nearby.\n\nThrough their work with the local community in Chipata, it became clear that a number of children in the province?s remote villages were going unvaccinated and succumbing to preventable diseases.\nThis was not because of the cost of the vaccinations; poverty, illness and distance prevented families from journeying to reach help. In response to this need, SOS Children?s Villages launched its mobile medical bus in 2011.\n\nToday, the bus offers services to six isolated and rural communities within a 62-mile radius of the town of Chipata. With one clinical officer and two nurses on board, the bus brings vital vaccinations against life- threatening diseases, as well as malaria screening, HIV testing and general health check-ups. In 2015, thanks to the bus? medical team and services provided by the SOS Medical Centre in Chipata, 19,500 children were immunised against preventable diseases.",
