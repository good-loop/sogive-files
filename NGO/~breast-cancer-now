  "description": "On 1 April 2019, Breast Cancer Now merged with support and information charity Breast Cancer Care to become the UK’s first comprehensive breast cancer charity - Breast Cancer Care and Breast Cancer Now. After developing the brand it is known now as Breast Cancer Now, the research and care charity. The charity continues to calls for a better access to drugs and treatments that have less damaging side effects, provides care services and makes grants to cancer research organisations.",
  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**Breast Cancer Now is tentatively rated as Not Recommended on the SoGive ratings scale**\n\n- Breast Cancer Now funds research and carries out public outreach and campaigning work to reduce the burden of breast cancer\n- Total expenditure in 2019-20 was £40m\n- The estimated cost-effectiveness of breast cancer research in the UK is £1k - £8.8k per year of healthy life (quality-adjusted life year, QALY) gained \n- Compared to the SoGive benchmark of £5,000 to save a life (or £100 - £200 per QALY gained), breast cancer research in the UK does not appear cost-effective\n- Without evidence that the research done by Breast Cancer Now is far more beneficial than average, we conclude that Breast Cancer Now also likely underperforms relative to the benchmark\n- Breast Cancer Now is thus rated as Not Recommended (tentative) on the SoGive ratings scale\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)? \nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what Breast Cancer Now does - how they spend your donations**\n\nBreast Cancer Now funds numerous research projects relating to breast cancer - a wide variety of research is supported, from Biology and Aetiology to early detection and diagnosis to treatment and drug discovery.\nThey’re also involved in public outreach, including various health promotion schemes and lifestyle advice to decrease the risk of developing breast cancer, as well as the provision of emotional and practical support services for individuals with breast cancer.\nFinally, they’re active in policy and campaigning to improve healthcare delivery, access to treatment and drugs, screening programs, and proficiency of the workforce.\nExpenditure on all the above activities totalled £40m, as detailed in the [2019-2020 annual report](https://breastcancernow.org/sites/default/files/campaign_files/breast_cancer_now_annual_report_and_accounts_2019-2020.pdf). No detailed breakdown on expenditure by project is provided.\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Breast Cancer Now compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of the Breast Cancer Now under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 to save one life, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nDue to the nature of benefits of medical research (i.e delay between research and implementation, and difficulty in exactly attributing a service to the research that contributed to it), it’s infeasible to figure out the effectiveness of the work of Breast Cancer Now specifically. Thus, we must rely on an estimate of the overall cost-effectiveness of breast cancer research in the UK as an approximation. Note also that we will only focus on Breast Cancer Now’s research function and exclude the outreach and campaigning work to determine cost-effectiveness - this relies on the assumption that a majority of their expenditure goes towards research, which is somewhat uncertain since they do not provide a more detailed breakdown of expenditure.\n\n[Glover et. al](https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7015-12-99) provide an estimate of the net monetary benefit and the rate of return of cancer research in the UK. To do so, they estimate the number of Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) gained from various \"key\" health interventions throughout the time period of 1991 to 2010 (summarised in [Table 2](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-12-99/tables/2)). One of these interventions is breast cancer screening and treatment, the combined estimate for which is 1.155m QALYs gained. To elaborate, one QALY is equivalent to one year of life in perfect health - by considering health-related quality of life, QALYs are a suitable metric for assessing health outcomes (more information can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year#cite_note-NICEglossary-2)). \n\nThey also estimate total research expenditure from 1970 to 2009 (see [Additional File 1](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2F1741-7015-12-99/MediaObjects/12916_2014_974_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx)), which comes out to £15.1bn. This expenditure is considered as that allocated to research which produced the gain in QALYs between 1990 and 2010. To estimate the proportion of this expenditure allocated to breast cancer, the National Cancer Research Institute’s [2020 Data Package](https://www.ncri.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Data-package_2020.xlsx) is used, which provides data on total research expenditure and expenditure by cancer type/site from 2002 to 2020. Only the data from 2002 to 2009 is considered as this falls within the scope of the time period used in Glover et. al. A large proportion of the expenditure is not labelled by cancer type or site, however - the proportion of labelled expenditure across 2002 to 2010 is calculated as 40%. Of the proportion of labelled expenditure, breast cancer-related research accounts for an estimated 19% across the time period. To extrapolate from the labelled expenditure to the total, we can estimate lower and upper bounds - i.e none of the unlabelled expenditure is related to breast cancer or all of it is. The resultant range of expenditure on breast cancer research from 1991 to 2010 is thus 7.6% - 67.6% of the total expenditure, or £1.15bn - £10.2bn.\n\nWith a gain of 1.155m QALYs over this time period, this implies the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer research is around £1,000 - £8,800 per QALY gained. Compared to the SoGive benchmark of £5,000 to save a life, which corresponds to approximately £100 - £200 per QALY gained, breast cancer research in the UK drastically underperforms. Since we have no indication that the research carried out by Breast Cancer Now is especially promising, we conclude that Breast Cancer Now also likely underperforms relative to the benchmark. This point remains uncertain though, so if we do come across evidence of the contrary, our relative cost-effectiveness assessment could change.\n\nNote that this estimate doesn’t account for the benefits past 2010 of the research carried out from 1970 to 2009. For the cost-effectiveness to become comparable to the benchmark, however, about an additional 5m - 50m QALYs would need to be gained going forward. Considering the average rate of 60,000 QALYs gained per year from 1990 to 2010, it would take about another 80 - 800 years for this benefit to be achieved, assuming the rate is constant. Research tends to become obsolete or have diminishing returns, however, for two reasons:\n- First, there is a degree of duplication so that eventually, the same results would have been arrived at regardless of any specific research. \n- Second, our environment changes and makes research results irrelevant.\nThus, it is highly unlikely that a large enough benefit would be achieved to make the research considered in this analysis cost-effective.\nSome key uncertainties remain in this analysis, however, which could significantly affect the cost-effectiveness estimate. One such consideration is that expenditure on research in other medical fields, not just cancer-related research, ultimately affects provisions and outcomes of cancer care. Another is that the effect of cancer research carried out in the UK on countries besides the UK is not considered - conversely, however, the effect of research performed outside of the UK on cancer care in the UK is also not considered.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Breast Cancer Now as Not Recommended (tentative) under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective.\n- We do have some indication of cost-effectiveness and believe that cost-effectiveness underperforms the Gold Standard, likely by a substantial margin. This indication is tentative as we relied on data that was not specific to Breast Cancer Now\n",
