I have not included the 101 cases where preparations were started but the wish \"sadly had to be cancelled\" (presumably the child died?) Arguably this is not giving enough credit, since the family and child presumably benefitted from knowing that things were being done for them, even if they didn\u0027t get the actual wish in the end.",

  "description": "Make-A-Wish UK has a group of [volunteers and staff members](https://www.make-a-wish.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/our-story/) who aim to bring joy to ailing children. The charity claims that [research](https://assets.make-a-wish.org.uk/live/media/filer_public/e1/1b/e11be253-bb90-4270-9a19-2fda07fbdaf6/make-a-wish-uk-2019-annual-accounts.pdf) has shown that wish-granting also strengthens family bonds previously strained because of the child\u0027s illness. A subsidiary company called [Make-A-Wish Promotions Ltd](https://www.make-a-wish.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/charity-information/) directs all of its profits to Make-a-wish UK.",
  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**Make-A-Wish UK is rated as Not Recommended (firm) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- Make A Wish grants wishes to children with life threatening or life limiting illnesses \n- Based on their [2020 annual report](https://assets.make-a-wish.org.uk/live/media/filer_public/32/3b/323be9bd-6513-4f6a-bcd4-aa9632846685/make-a-wish-uk-2020-annual-accounts.pdf#page\u003d16\u0026zoom\u003dauto,-35,370), we believe that Make A Wish UK spent over £12,000 per wish granted \n- For this to reach the SoGive Gold Standard of £200 to avert one year of severe depression, a child would need to see a benefit equivalent to averting severe depression for about 60 years, which we think is highly unlikely.\n- For this reason, it is likely that a donation to Make A Wish UK will achieve less positive impact than the same amount of money given to a Gold-rated organization.\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what Make A Wish UK does - how they spend your donations**\n\n\nMake A Wish UK grants wishes to children [aged 3-17 (inclusive)](https://www.make-a-wish.org.uk/wishes/wish-eligibility/) with [critical or life limiting illnesses](https://www.make-a-wish.org.uk/wishes/wish-eligibility/). Wishes are roughly divided into [4 categories](https://www.make-a-wish.org.uk/wishes/apply-for-a-wish/) : meeting someone (e.g a celebrity), being someone or something (e.g a character in a film), going somewhere (e.g disneyland) and having something (e.g. a toy). \nIn their [2020 annual report](https://assets.make-a-wish.org.uk/live/media/filer_public/32/3b/323be9bd-6513-4f6a-bcd4-aa9632846685/make-a-wish-uk-2020-annual-accounts.pdf) Make a Wish UK claims to have granted 702 wishes in the period July 2019 to August 2020 (page 9). As one wish is granted per child, the wishes of 702 children were granted.  Spending allocated to wishes for the year ended August 2020 was £5.1m, including support costs. The total expenditure by Make A Wish in 2020 was £8.4m.\nMake A Wish UK’s immediate future plans involve mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Wishes granted fell to 702 from 1114 wishes from the previous year, and the income from donations fell. They aim to increase income by establishing new marketing channels and fostering greater connections with communities to assist in granting wishes. \n\n\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Make A Wish UK compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of Make A Wish UK’s work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold rating, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nIn their [2020 annual report](https://assets.make-a-wish.org.uk/live/media/filer_public/32/3b/323be9bd-6513-4f6a-bcd4-aa9632846685/make-a-wish-uk-2020-annual-accounts.pdf) Make a Wish UK claims to have granted 702 wishes in the period July 2019 to August 2020, with the average cost of about £12,000 per wish (£8.41m/702). Because we could not find what wishes Make A Wish grants, we cannot assess their impact on the children. We do know they [do not grant wishes](https://www.make-a-wish.org.uk/wishes/choosing-your-wish/restrictions-on-wishes-we-can-grant/) for medical equipment or wheelchair adaptations, so we can assume the main objective of the wishes is to improve their mental health by bringing joy to the children. Therefore, we use our Gold Standard benchmark of  £200 to avert one year of severe depression. At £12,000 spent per wish, each wish granted by Make a Wish would have to provide benefits equivalent to alleviating 60 years of severe depression in order to reach our Gold Standard. Even if we take into account the positive impact of these wishes on family members and the community, it is likely the impact is well below our benchmark. Furthermore, as Make A Wish does not grant wishes for medical equipment, one could argue these funds would have more impact spent on equipment that would improve the quality of life of the child. In the absence of Make a Wish existing families could also use crowdfunding services online to fund these wishes. \n\nMake A Wish UK has stated they have established a metric to assess the impact of the wishes, and the wellbeing they generate. If this metric shows the impact of the wish provides benefits equivalent to the alleviation of 60 years of severe depression, we will update our ratings. However, as it stands it is likely that a donation to the Make a Wish UK will achieve less positive impact than the same amount of money given to a Gold-rated organisation.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze ratings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Make A Wish UK as Not Recommended (firm) under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective\n- We do have some indication of cost-effectiveness, and have very high confidence that cost-effectiveness underperforms the Gold Standard, likely by a substantial margin",
