  "recommendation": "**Children With Cancer UK is rated as Not Recommended (tentative) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n**Summary**\n\n- Children with Cancer UK is a charity dedicated to improving survival rates and the quality of life in young cancer survivors and to finding ways to prevent cancer in the future.\n- Cancer is the [leading cause of death]( https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/childrens-cancers/mortality#heading-Four) for children aged 1-14 in the UK and accounted for 22% of deaths in this age group in 2019.\n- [Previous research]( https://sogive.org/#charity?charityId\u003dcancer-research-uk) that looked at the cost-effectiveness of cancer research for all age groups combined suggests that cancer research costs around £1,600 per QALY (year of life in perfect health) gained, which implies that cancer research is about 10x less cost-effective than SoGive’s Gold Standard rated charities. We do not expect that childhood cancer research is 10x more cost-effective than this estimate.\n- Children with Cancer UK spends about 60% of its funds on research. The remaining 40% is spent on awareness campaigns and welfare projects. In order to assess the cost-effectiveness of these two programs, we require information on the number of people reached plus the costs for each of the activities listed under these projects individually. Currently, the information provided by the charity is too incomplete for us to perform a cost-effectiveness assessment on these projects. \n- For these reasons, we rate Children With Cancer UK as Not Recommended. The charity receives a tentative rather than firm rating because we recognize that there is significant uncertainty in our cost-effectiveness estimate of overall cancer research and childhood cancer research in particular. We welcome further research into this area.\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what Children With Cancer UK does - how they spend your donations**\n\nChildren With Cancer UK is a charity which aims to understand what causes children to develop cancer, to develop improved treatments and to provide care for affected children and their families. In their [annual report]( https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA11451909\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d298405) for the financial year 2020 ending December 30th, Children With Cancer UK report spending a total of £15.3m on four types of charitable projects (p.63-65):\n- Research into treatment (39%): Developing new approaches to diagnosis, identifying markers of likely outcomes, minimizing the risk of adverse, treatment-related effects, and tackling forms of childhood cancer that still elude successful treatment.\n- Research into prevention and causes (21%): Understanding why childhood cancer develops, finding explanations for the increase in risk of cancer, and establishing whether prevention is a possibility.\n- Welfare (21%): Providing care to childhood cancer victims and their families by organizing free days out, funding support services such as financial grants, and free accommodation close to children’s hospitals across the UK.\n- Raising awareness (19%): Organizing awareness days and fundraising events.   \n\n*Childhood cancer in the UK*\n\nWhile childhood cancer is relatively rare, with 1,800 new cases of childhood cancer every year in the UK, it is the [leading cause of death]( https://stateofchildhealth.rcpch.ac.uk/evidence/mortality/child-mortality/) among children, accounting for 22% of all deaths among children aged 1-14 in the UK in 2019. Yet, cancer in children accounts for [less than 1%](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/childrens-cancers#heading-Zero) of all new cancer cases in the UK. Since the early 1990s, incidence rates for cancer in young people have increased by around a quarter (24%) in the UK. Rates in females have increased by more than a third (35%), and rates in males have increased by a seventh (14%). It is thought that some of this increase is due to improvements in diagnosis and registration. The past few decades have however seen significant improvements in survival rates among children with cancer. In the 1970s, [more than a third]( https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/childrens-cancers#heading-Zero) of children diagnosed with cancer survived for 10 years or more, whereas today this number is over three-quarters, meaning that survival rates have more than doubled. We do however see considerable variation in survival rates across cancer types. Over the last decade, mortality rates among childhood cancer victims have decreased by 21% in the UK.\n\n*Childhood cancer research and its benefits*\n\nUnderstanding the overall benefits of biomedical research is an active research field in itself. There are numerous studies of the positive effects of cancer research in general beyond childhood cancer. For example, a recent [study by Lichtenberg]( https://voxeu.org/article/impact-biomedical-innovation-cancer-mortality) finds that \"new drugs launched in 36 countries during 2006-2010 reduced the number of disability-adjusted life years lost to cancer in 2015 in those countries by about 8.7%\". Looking back further, he calculates that if there had been no new drug launches during 1982-2010, there would have been an additional 26 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2015 in those 36 countries. The DALY is a measure of the burden of disease. One DALY represents the loss of the equivalent of one year of full health (See [this WHO post for more details]( https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/158)). Cancer Research UK estimates in their [facts and figures]( https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/mortality/all-cancers-combined#heading-One) that 832,000 cancer deaths were avoided in the UK between the 1980s and 2016 because of improvements in cancer research worldwide. These findings however concern cancer research for all age groups combined, and there is currently very limited research on the benefits of childhood cancer research specifically. \n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how Children With Cancer UK compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of Children With Cancer UK’s work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold rating, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, which is similar to saving one quality-adjusted life year for £100-200) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\n*Childhood cancer research*\n\nSome of our [earlier research]( https://sogive.org/#charity?charityId\u003dcancer-research-uk) has looked at the cost-effectiveness of cancer research for all age groups combined, and has estimated a cost of £1,600 per QALY gained (a measure equivalent to one year of life in perfect health). This suggests that cancer research is around 10x less cost-effective than our benchmark of £100-200 per QALY. There exists considerable uncertainty around this estimate, regarding both cancer research in general and childhood cancer research in particular:\n- The cost we calculated does not account for lives saved worldwide through research undertaken in the UK. We estimate this could lower costs per life saved by a factor of between 5 and 20. Conversely, the benefit of research completed outside the UK to patients in the UK is excluded in some of the research that our estimate relies on.\n- Topics relevant to cancer - cell biology, genetics, the immune system - are also relevant to understanding other diseases, so cancer research may have ‘spillover’ effects which benefit treatments of other diseases. However, by the same logic, some of the improvements in cancer treatments are likely due to research that was originally funded for other (non-cancer) purposes.\n- There are strong indicators that cancer research shows diminishing returns. This [study]( https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf) from 2020 finds that the effectiveness of cancer research has declined by a factor of 8 between 1985 and 2006 (p. 24). By contrast, advances in AI could [potentially greatly improve biomedical research productivity](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57929095).\n- Our estimate is based on cancer research for all age groups combined, and childhood cancer research may be more (or less) cost-effective than adult cancer research. \n- Finally, Children With Cancer UK may fund research that is more (or less) cost-effective than the average for cancer research.\nA more in-depth analysis of childhood cancer research would explore these factors above. However, as it stands, we think it is unlikely that the true cost per-year-of-life in perfect health gained is 10x less than our central estimate.\nChildren With Cancer UK spends about 60% of its budget on research, with the remaining 40% divided between welfare projects (21%) and awareness campaigns (19%).\n\n*Welfare projects*\n\nAs part of their welfare projects, Children with Cancer UK provides financial assistance to families experiencing financial hardships relating to their child’s cancer treatment, organises days out and provides funds for hospitals to improve the experiences of children suffering from cancer. Unfortunately the report does not state how the total funds for welfare projects are divided between these three activities. An [impact report]( https://www.childrenwithcancer.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-Impact-Report.pdf) dating from 2019 states that in 2017, some 1,510 families received financial assistance. In addition, we would require information on the average amount of money received by each family and an indication of the effect on their wellbeing to make a cost-effectiveness assessment. Similarly, for the other two activities listed under welfare projects we require information on their costs, the number of people reached, and an indication of how they impacted the wellbeing of their recipients.\n \n*Awareness campaigns*\n\nWe learn from the impact report that the charity was in the newspapers 630 times, had 9,000 followers and received nearly half a million visits to its website (p. 34). It is also stated that the charity intends for an increased public profile to result in improvements for childhood cancer through influencing the public and policy agenda (p. 34). One example that is mentioned to illustrate this type of work is the Precision Medicine Initiative, which Children With Cancer UK called to public attention by announcing funding for the project in the House of Commons. While this potentially has an effect on future government funding of childhood cancer research, we would like to see examples of cases where Children with Cancer UK was able to leverage funds for childhood cancer research that would have plausibly gone elsewhere (i.e. to less cost-effective ends) in the absence of their awareness campaigns. \nFor the reasons outlined in the previous two sections, we require more information to perform a cost-effectiveness assessment of Children with Cancer UK’s welfare projects and awareness campaigns. Considering that research makes up 60% of the charity’s spending, we have used our cost-effectiveness estimate for childhood cancer research as indicative of Children with Cancer UK’s overall cost-effectiveness. \n\n*Conclusion*\n\nBased on the above, we tentatively rate Children With Cancer UK as Not Recommended (tentative) under SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective\n- We do have some indication of cost-effectiveness, and have very high confidence that cost-effectiveness underperforms the Gold Standard, likely by a substantial margin. \n",
