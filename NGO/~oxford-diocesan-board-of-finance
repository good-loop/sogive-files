  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**The Oxford Diocesan Board of Finance is rated as Not Recommended (Firm) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- The Oxford Diocesan Board of Finance’s (ODBF) objective is \"to benefit the public by promoting and assisting the mission and other work of the Church of England in and beyond the boundaries of the Diocese of Oxford\".\n- Based on its 2020 annual report, we believe the average cost to the charity per regular worshipper in the churches of the Diocese of Oxford was about £540.\n- For this cost, a Gold-rated organisation could be expected to avert about 3 years of severe depression. While there may be positive impacts on well-being from being a regular worshipper in the churches of the Diocese of Oxford, we do not believe these are as good as averting 3 years of severe depression.\n- For this reason, it is very likely that a donation to the ODBF will achieve less positive impact than the same amount of money given to a Gold-rated organisation and we therefore do not recommend donating to the ODBF at the current time..\n\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n\n**More about what the ODBF does - how they spend your donations**\n\nThe charity’s 2020 annual report states that the \"main role of the ODBF is to identify and manage the financial aspects of the provision of mission and ministry within the Diocese [of Oxford] so as to provide appropriate personnel and financial resources to assist the Diocesan Synod, Bishop’s Council, deaneries and parishes to further the Christian mission and strategic priorities in the Diocese\" ([2020 annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA11290946\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d247954), pp. 2 and 3). The ODBF’s total expenditure of £29.9M for 2020 was allocated as follows ([2020 annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA11290946\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d247954), pp. 27, 41 and 44):\n- Charitable activities (96%):\n\t- Resourcing Ministry \u0026 Mission (65%).\n\t- Support for parish ministry \u0026 training (17%).\n- Contributions to Archbishops’ Council (7.4%).\n- Expenditure on grants (6.1%):\n\t- Development Fund Grants (3.8%).\n- Grants to Oxford Diocesan Board of Education (0.9%).\n- Other grants (1.4%).\n- Raising and managing funds (2.7%).\n- Other property costs (1.6%).\n\nThere are about 55k regular worshippers in the churches of the Diocese of Oxford ([About the Diocese of Oxford](https://www.oxford.anglican.org/who-we-are/)).\n\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does the ODBF compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of the ODBF under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nFurther information about the impact of ODBF’s charitable activities on the beneficiaries would be needed in order to robustly estimate its cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, a meaningful comparison with the Gold Standard can be made based on the charity’s total annual expenditure of £29.9M, and the 55k regular worshippers in the churches of the Diocese of Oxford. These imply an average cost per worshipper of around £540 during 2020.\n\nFor this to match the SoGive Gold Standard of £200 to avert one year of severe depression, the average impact per regular worshipper would have to be an improvement in well-being equivalent to averting about 3 years of severe depression (£543 / £200 \u003d 2.7). While there may be positive impacts on well-being from being a regular worshipper in the churches of the Diocese of Oxford, we do not believe these achieve an outcome as good as averting 3 years of severe depression.\n\nThe charitable activities might reach people who are not regular worshippers in the churches of the Diocese of Oxford, but the effect on people less strongly connected to the churches would likely be smaller. Moreover, even assuming ODBF and the churches of the Diocese of Oxford reached 10 times as many people as their regular worshippers, the average impact per person would have to be an improvement in well-being equivalent to averting about 3 months of severe depression (543 / 200 * 12 / 10 \u003d 3.3). Consequently, it is highly likely that a donation to the ODBF will achieve less positive impact than the same amount of money given to a Gold-rated organisation.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate the Oxford Diocesan Board of Finance as Not Recommended (Firm) under the SoGive methodology. \n",
