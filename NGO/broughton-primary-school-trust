  "description": "Broughton Primary is a city centre school in the heart of Edinburgh, with a wide catchment area and a rich mix of cultures and faiths, committed to bringing the best to each of our children.\n\nBroughton Primary School Trust was set up to support the Friends at Broughton (FAB) to make the most of fundraising opportunities which benefit the children, staff and parents who make the school a vital and much loved part of the local community.\n\nThroughout the year we run events to raise money for Broughton and to date we\u0027ve funded Gaelic football, loose play parts for outdoor fun and learning, iPads for digital learning, scooterpods and established our \u0027Cultural Fund\u0027 so that all classes can get out and about in our brilliant city. \n\nBeing in the heart of a busy, and developing community brings with it challenges as the school roll grows and with one in four of our families living in poverty, we are committed to ensuring our fundraising benefits everyone and no-one is left behind.\n\nChildren, staff and parents are working together to achieve an ambitious and much needed vision for a better environment and the best school life we can offer for the children who attend the school, and live in the local area.",
  "recommendation": "Extra support for UK school children is commendable for those connected to the community. The benefits of a donation are not considered comparable to e.g. providing malaria nets.",
