  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**The Motor Neurone Disease Association is rated as Not Recommended (Firm) on the SoGive ratings scale**\n\n- The Motor Neurone Disease Association (MNDA) provides support, grants, and information to those with motor neurone disease, campaigns on their behalf, and funds research.\n- MNDA did not estimate the total number of individuals supported in 2020, but given the total number of those with MND in the UK, and past estimates, it probably supported around 4,000 people at a cost of £9 million, or around £2,250 per person per year. \n- Given the nature of MNDA’s support-ancillary to the NHS’s work, and largely non-medical-it is unlikely that its impact makes it cost-effective compared to the SoGive Gold Standard. \n- Considering that the money required to fund the care of one person through the Motor Neurone Disease Association could, if instead donated to a Gold-rated charity, provide a benefit equivalent to alleviating nearly 12 years of severe depression, we do not recommend donating to the MNDA. \n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what the Motor Neurone Disease Association does- how they spend your donations**\n\nThe Motor Neurone Disease Association supports those in the UK affected by motor neurone disease, along with their families, through direct work such as counselling, distribution of communication aids, and support grants to individuals, as well as funding for care centres where those with MND can receive specialised care. It also funds research on MND, and campaigns for greater awareness of the disease and government funding of support and research. In its [annual report for the financial year ended 31 December 2020](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/charity-details/294354/accounts-and-annual-returns), it reported £15.6 million in total expenditure.\n\nThe MND Association’s largest activity is care and support. In 2020 the association spent a little under £9 million on such activities, including support and fundraising costs. Because there is not yet a cure for MND, much of their work is focused on improving patients’ quality of life. The MNDA provides grants to individuals for things like respite care, building adaptations, and equipment rentals, and helps fund local care centres, which are hubs for specialised medical care and counselling. It also provides information and emotional support through expert advice, counselling, and regular phone calls. The association’s Welfare Benefits Advice Service also helped individuals with MND claim an additional £1.5 million from the government in 2020 (the associations’ impact report does not specify how many individuals).\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThe MNDA spent £3.7 million in 2020 on research, which was down from £5.4 million in 2019. The association\u0027s reduced overall spending in 2020 means that it could have increased its spending on research in 2021, though due to the pandemic it anticipated falling short of its fundraising goals, so spending on research may fall again in the future. It is currently helping to fund 85 studies on MND globally, both on its causes and treatments. In addition to funding, MNDA also helps recruit participants for clinical trials and hosts an annual Symposium on MND research.\n\nThe association also spent £2.3 million on campaigning. In 2020 volunteers across Britain tried to get individuals with MND included on the Extremely Clinically Vulnerable List, which would have prioritised them for vaccinations and other services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their efforts were successful in Northern Ireland.\n\nFinally, MNDA spent £0.7 million on volunteering.\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does the MNDA compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\t\t\nAfter a review of the work of The Motor Neurone Disease Association under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as averting one year of severe depression for £200, or doubling consumption (spending) for one year for £50), and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar), and for more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\t\n*Care and Support Activities*\n\nWe can begin by assessing the cost-effectiveness of the MNDA’s care and support activities, since these account for the largest proportion of the organisation’s expenditure, around three-fifths. First we need to figure out how many individuals receive support. In their annual report, MNDA notes that 5,000 individuals are known to have MND at any given time in the UK. In their [2018 annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/charity-details/294354/accounts-and-annual-returns) they stated that they offered information and support to approximately 4,570 individuals that year. It’s not clear how this figure was reached, and a similar estimate does not appear in its 2019 or 2020 reports. \n\nHere are some numbers we do have from the association’s 2020 annual report and impact [report](https://www.mndassociation.org/about-us/who-we-are/strategy-and-annual-reports/impact-report/): 2,479 people received £1.4 million in grants; 16,000 people accessed their online information hub; 3,300 people were offered information and emotional support by volunteers. Compare this to £1.4 million in grants in 2019 and £1.4 million in 2018, and 2,900 offered ongoing emotional support in 2018 (we could not find such a number for 2019), and it seems plausible that the number of individuals supported has remained roughly constant. Of course, the pandemic has limited in-person use of care centres, but we can settle on 4,000 as a crude estimate of the number of people supported during 2020. This is likely an overestimate, but it will allow us to make our recommendation.\n\nTaking the total expenditure on care and support, £9 million, and our estimate of 4,000 people supported, we estimate that the MNDA spends around £2,250 to support someone for one year. When attempting to quantify the benefits of MNDA’s support, we have to acknowledge that its medical support only augments that already provided by the NHS. Given this, it seems fair to compare the efforts of the association to one of SoGive’s benchmarks, averting one year of severe depression for £200, since the MNDA’s impact is largely aimed at improving the emotional wellbeing of its beneficiaries. To compare the two, imagine we spent £2,250 on a Gold-rated charity focused on alleviating severe depression. In that case, we would expect to see at least 11 years of severe depression alleviated, given the cost of £200 per year. It seems unlikely that participation in an MND support group for one year, for example, is as good as alleviating 11 years of severe depression, or, put another way, that participating in a support group is, on a yearly basis, 11 times better than being freed of severe depression. So we can be fairly sure that the MNDA’s care and support activities don’t meet SoGive’s Gold-rating. \n\n*Research*\n\nTurning to research, there are several things we need to consider in order to assess the MNDA’s impact. According to [an analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(18)30404-6/fulltext), there were around 331,000 people living with motor neuron diseases globally in 2016, resulting in 926,000 [disability adjusted life years](https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/158) (DALYs), or years lost of full health through death and disability. Treatments for motor neuron diseases (MND encompasses a number of ailments, so we are talking about needing multiple treatments) would help avert these losses. But when it comes to assessing the Motor Neurone Disease Association’s impact, we need to ask how much sooner treatments will be found, given the MNDA’s specific efforts. \n\nAn in-depth analysis of the particularities of MND research is beyond the scope of this editorial. Still, we can comment on the MNDA’s research activities in light of its other work and previous analyses. Depending on the biomedical research in question, impact can vary widely (see [this post](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2017/08/donating-to-medical-research-heres-why.html)): the creation of certain vaccines can reasonably expect to cost under £100 per DALY averted, while cancer research (see SoGive analysis of [Cancer Research UK](https://app.sogive.org/#charity?charityId\u003dcancer-research-uk)) may be closer to £2000 per DALY averted. Even in the unlikely scenario that MNDA’s care and support activities are equivalent to one DALY averted for each individual supported in a given year, and supposing their research activities avert one DALY for each £100 spent, their average cost effectiveness would still be around £300 per DALY averted (without accounting for campaigning), which does not match SoGive’s Gold standard.  \n\n*Campaigning*\nAs with research above, the questions needed to be confident about the impact of campaigning are beyond the scope of the present analysis. Given the association’s relatively low expenditure on campaigning (£2.3 million), it will not be a factor in our estimate of the organisation’s cost-effectiveness as a whole. \n\n\n*Overall*\n\nBecause MNDA’s care and support activities make up the majority, three-fifths, of its expenditure, we believe they are reasonably representative of the charity’s cost-effectiveness as a whole. So our estimate-£2,250 to support someone for one year-is the primary basis of our rating. Depending on the impact of MND research, this may be an overestimate of the true cost-effectiveness of the MNDA, but not to such a degree that it would affect our rating, as we show above. Absent further information, there are no strong indicators that the association’s work is cost-effective compared to the SoGive Gold Standard. That being said, we remain open to evidence showing that we have underestimated the cost-effectiveness of its activities.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate the Motor Neurone Disease Association as Not Recommended (firm) under the SoGive methodology. \n",
