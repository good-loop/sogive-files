  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n**Brooke - Action for Working Horses and Donkeys is rated as More Information Needed (promising) on the SoGive ratings scale**\n- Brooke is a charity that works to improve the wellbeing of working horses, donkeys, and mules (equids) in the developing world.\n- Based on their [2021 annual report]( https://www.thebrooke.org/sites/default/files/Downloads/Brooke_Annual_Financial_and_Administrative_Report_2021_InteractivePDF.pdf), Brooke spent £17.6million on animal welfare interventions and reached 1.6 million equids directly, at a cost per equid of £11.\n- To reach the SoGive Gold Standard on animal welfare grounds, a charity would need to provide benefits equivalent to averting the suffering of one chicken living in very poor conditions at a cost of £5.\n- Brooke’s cost per animal is somewhat more expensive than this, but their work might reach the benchmark nonetheless because the effects of their work may persist after they stop working with the community. Furthermore, their work could increase the income of those in the developing world.\n- Consequently, Brooke is rated as More Information Needed (promising)\n \n**The SoGive approach**\n Under the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n **More about what Brooke does - how they spend your donations**\nBrooke is a charity that works to improve the wellbeing of working horses, donkeys, and mules (equids) in the developing world.\n85% of Brooke’s charitable expenditures go towards directly intervening to improve animal welfare and trying to prevent animal welfare problems occurring. Some of these actions include: training up farriers (people who make horseshoes) to reduce the prevalence of feet injuries, providing animals with shelter, and supporting their general health such as via vaccinations and improved feeding practices.\nThe remainder of their charitable activities primarily goes toward campaigning for law changes that would benefit equids and their owners, with the rest going into research that can aid their other activities. One example of their campaigning is their efforts to get governments to restrict the donkey skin trade, which is causing donkeys in West Africa to be stolen and then slaughtered in a painful manner.\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Brooke compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\nAfter a review of the work of Brooke under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5 to avert the severe suffering of a chicken, or £50 to double someone’s income for a year) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\nBrooke states they reached 1.6 million animals in 2021 through their main activities of preventing animal welfare problems and direct intervention to help equids, spending £17.6 million (adjusted for support and fundraising costs) on these areas. This equates to an average cost of £11 per equid reached, although the full costs may be somewhat higher as Brooke partners with other organisations to deliver some of their services. With these low costs, they possibly come close to the SoGive Gold Standard benchmark for animal welfare of £5 to avert the severe suffering of a chicken for a year. Furthermore, if their work does prevent severe suffering, it is possible they reach the Gold Standard with their low costs. This is because they regularly exit communities after undertaking their work, meaning this £11 may alleviate more than one year’s suffering, if the work’s effects persist after leaving. Furthermore the £5 benchmark relates to chickens; some donors may place greater value on equids than on chickens. Finally, it’s also possible their work also makes progress towards our Gold Standard via increasing the incomes of those in poverty. This could happen because improvements in a working equid’s health could translate to increased productivity and some of the training they provide in skills such as farriery is marketable.\nAs well as directly working with animals and owners, it is also possible their campaigning work could be impactful as well. To gauge how effective their campaigns are we would use the SoGive [three-question method]( http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html) for systemic change. This method first asks how much the campaigning project costs, how much positive impact does the change create, and how much sooner does change occur because of the charity’s work? As Brooke’s campaigning budget is under one million pounds a year and they campaign on issues that affect millions of animals and their owners each year, such as donkeys being stolen and slaughtered for their skin, it is possible that their campaigning could be cost-effective. However, this depends on how many successful policy changes their campaigns are decisive in winning, as it would not make sense to attribute successes to them that would have happened anyway or were won by other organisations.\nFor these reasons, we rate Brooke as More Information Needed (promising). In order to reach a firm recommendation, the following information would be required:\n-          Robust evidence on the average effect on the animals and people reached by Brooke’s initiatives. Although Brooke does conduct some project evaluations, it would be useful to have more details on the nature of all their projects, alongside some information on how much each of their interventions achieve towards their goals such as preventing animal suffering. Additionally, some information on how much any effects of their interventions persist after they leave a community would be critical to any assessment.\n-          Furthermore, we would want to assess the quality of any evidence provided by Brooke on the effectiveness of their projects. This would mean reviewing the methodologies used to reach any claims about impact and seeing if it is sufficiently robust to support their claims. Useful evidence could include evidence from animal welfare experts on the effects of different interventions, detailed data on how animals and people are affected by Brooke entering a community, or randomised control trials.\n-          Details on how the costs of their projects are distributed between Brooke and their partner organisations. This information could increase the costs per animal reached which forms an important part of our cost-effectiveness analysis.\n-          Greater information on what kinds of campaigns, large and small, that Brooke engages in and what role they play in such campaigns. Additionally, information on which campaigns were and weren’t successful would be important to assess effectiveness here. We would also want to know campaigns they plan to run in the future.\n-          A fuller analysis would also assess management capability. For example, this would involve assessing Brooke’s capabilities around Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (or MEL) to ensure that they are learning from their mistakes (and not simply publishing evaluation reports that don’t change anything), and understanding how the leadership sets strategy and selects projects; in particular, how the charity incorporates cost-effectiveness thinking into its strategic decisions.\n **Conclusion**\nBased on the above, we rate Brooke as More Information Needed (promising) under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n-          We do have some indications of their cost-effectiveness. These indications suggest that there is a possibility that their impact per pound matches or exceeds the Gold Standard, but this depends on further data and analysis.\n",
