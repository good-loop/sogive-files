From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n\n**More about what Mission Aviation Fellowship does - how they spend your donations**\n\n([Mission Aviation Fellowship](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA11156455\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d1058226), p.2) is an organisation that provides subsidised aviation services in remote places of the world that have challenging surface travel, whether due to geography or surrounding danger. It provides staff, pilots, and planes to work in conjunction with hundreds of other organisations, including national churches, relief and development agencies, missions, hospitals, and governments, in order to transport people or cargo. It [focuses](https://mafint.org/media/13/download?attachment) on providing medical services, disaster relief, development aid, education services, and Christian evangelism. Along with providing these primary services, MAF also provides some services related to its expertise in aviation: airstrip construction and maintenance, flight training, and engineering services.\n\n([MAF](https://mafint.org/media/13/download?attachment), p.7) is composed of the international organisation as well as 19 national chapters. Any donations go to the national chapters, which use some of these funds to support the international organisation. The international organisation in turn uses some of this capital to provide grants, almost all of which go back to select national chapters.

However, the anecdotes provided by the two organisations are largely the same, so it is unclear who has provided the services in these cases.\n\nNeither MAF International nor MAF UK quantifies the exact outcomes for each of its beneficiaries, but MAF International does provide some broad numbers about its services.

After subtracting the amount it received in fees from providing its services, £6.9 million, and re-allocating its fundraising costs, £266,000, to its projects, MAF International spent £19 million on providing its services and £1.2 million on grants for a total of £20.3 million on donor-funded charitable activities. Any overhead costs are once again included.\n\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Mission Aviation Fellowship compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of Mission Aviation Fellowship under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or doubling consumption (spending) for one year for £50) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nBecause MAF UK does not provide much data on its services, we do not have the ability to assess its operations satisfactorily. As for MAF International, despite knowing the amount of cargo and number of passengers transported, and the number of passengers receiving different categories of help, we still cannot give a confident assessment of its effectiveness.\n\nIn order to convey how effective it is at helping people, MAF could track and provide more specific information about its services such as the exact ways its passengers are benefiting, the contents of the cargo being transported, the organisations that are using MAF\u0027s services, and how the situation for beneficiaries would likely be different without MAF. Additionally, it would be helpful to be clearer on differentiating MAF International’s work from the work of the national chapters.\n\nGiven its 2020 expenditure of £19 million on flight services, we can calculate what benefits MAF International would need to have provided in order to achieve the SoGive Gold Standard. Its two primary flight services, transporting passengers and transporting cargo, most closely align with the SoGive benchmarks of saving people’s lives and increasing people’s consumption, respectively. Through these methods, if MAF International was able to produce an equivalent increase in well-being of saving two people’s lives for every 100 passengers it transported as well as producing an equivalent increase in well-being of doubling 28 people’s consumption for a year for every 100 kg of cargo it transported, it would have done enough to achieve the SoGive Gold Standard. Alternatively, it could also have done the equivalent of saving four people’s lives per 100 passengers and doubling 21 people’s consumption per 100 kg of cargo or saving six people’s lives per 100 passengers and doubling 14 people’s consumption per 100 kg of cargo.\n\nIn addition to providing its primary flight services, MAF also gives out grants and provides services related to its flight expertise. Because the grants stay almost entirely within MAF, we can assume their effectiveness is in line with MAF’s services. Any infrastructure built or flight expertise shared probably has some direct benefit as well as some positive externalities, but we do not have enough information to be able to say how much.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBecause we do not have enough details of MAF’s implementation of its services, we rate both Mission Aviation Fellowship International and Mission Aviation Fellowship UK as More Information Needed under the SoGive methodology.\n",
