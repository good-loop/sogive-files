  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**Comic Relief is rated as More Information Needed on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- Comic Relief organises entertainment events to generate donations and then use these funds to pursue their goal of a \"Just World, Free From Poverty\" by providing grants to a number of charitable organisations.\n- In 2020/21 they supported 172 organisations with new investments granting a total of £65.8m (see page 19 of their [annual report](https://assets.ctfassets.net/zsfivwzfgl3t/Zyt3hfxuavgJC5LvUDovZ/eaff608202d918317cf8fe93105233fb/Charity_Projects_Annual_Report_202021_Signed.pdf), typically they aim to split their grants 50/50 between UK and international projects.\n- Examples of [charities awarded grants in 2021](https://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/search?query\u003dcomic+relief\u0026default_field\u003d%2A\u0026sort\u003d_score+desc\u0026awardDate\u003d2021\u0026page\u003d1) include Starting Strong (addressing inequalities facing marginalised mothers and babies in the UK), Psychiatric Disability Organisation (aiming to increase the uptake of evidence-based youth-friendly mental health services in Kenya), and BELONG (supporting young refugee and asylum seekers aged 14-25 living in Cardiff and surrounding areas).\n- In order to better understand the impact of their work we need more information about the specific allocations of grants and the outcomes achieved by their programmes - such as the typical impact on health and poverty.\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what Comic Relief does - how they spend your donations**\n\nComic Relief organises entertainment events like the Red Nose Day and Sports Relief to encourage the (primarily UK) audience to donate. They then use these funds to pursue their goal of reducing inequality, addressing social injustices, and promoting sustainable change by providing grants to a number of charitable organisations (circa 172 organisations in 2020/21). They aim to split their allocation of funds roughly evenly between the UK and developing countries (they operate in 14 other countries: Bangladesh, Ghana, India, Kenya, Malawi, Nepal, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe). In 2021 Comic Relief granted a total of £65.8m to projects (£41.6m to the UK and £24.2m internationally, but this uneven split is unrepresentative of their normal 50/50 allocation and was largely due to timing issues related to their unrestricted investments most of which have been shifted into next year). Unfortunately their annual report provides little information on the size of grants allocated to different projects and cause areas and the outputs achieved by these grants.\n\nAs of Feb 2022 Comic Relief’s key program areas are:\n- [Homelessness and refugee rights](https://www.comicrelief.com/what-your-money-does/safe-places): Over the past 2 years Comic Relief claim to have helped support 34,700 people experiencing or at risk of homelessness to access safe accommodation and specialist support. They also claim to have helped to support more than 170,000 refugees and asylum seekers.  \n- [Children (mainly health \u0026 nutrition)](https://www.comicrelief.com/what-your-money-does/survive-and-thrive): Over the past 2 years Comic Relief claim to have helped support 691,000 people to increase their awareness or access improved maternal, neonatal and child health services in Africa and Asia\n- [Safety \u0026 Equality for Women and Girls](https://www.comicrelief.com/what-your-money-does/gender): Over the past 2 years Comic Relief claim to have helped support more than 500,000 women and girls in the UK and more than 5.2 million internationally\n- [Better Mental \u0026 Health](https://www.comicrelief.com/what-your-money-does/positive-mental-health): Over the past 2 years Comic Relief claim to have helped support 40,700 people experiencing or at risk of mental health problems to access the quality services they need.\n\nPlease note that these figures don’t completely add up to the 11.7 million people Comic Relief claim to have helped over the past 2 years on their main [\"what your money does\" page](https://www.comicrelief.com/what-your-money-does). For the cost-effectiveness analysis below we have used the 11.7 million figure so as to be more generous to Comic Relief but also to avoid guessing in which country certain outputs were achieved e.g. improved access to quality mental health services.\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Comic Relief compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of Comic Relief’s work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold rating, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert 1 year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nWe could not gather enough information from the annual report to perform a detailed analysis, or form opinions about their work under the SoGive methodology. Whilst Comic Relief do have a MEL (Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning) [strategy](https://assets.ctfassets.net/zsfivwzfgl3t/uADvElCIoRZ08L3H65NsF/1fe0973ca8be3d61c293565ab4be074a/cr_grants_applying_Comic-Relief-MEL-strategy.pdf) and expect their grantees to report on their outputs sadly these reports are not publicly available. You can also find some impact reports for overall programs run by Comic Relief [here](https://www.comicrelief.com/funding/reports-and-publications) but these don’t cover all of the work Comic Relief funds and often don’t explicitly clarify how much funding was granted by Comic Relief and other organisations for the project in question.\n\nThis is mainly because the annual report did not contain sufficient details on how funds were allocated across the hundreds of charities that Comic Relief donates to. Further, 65% of the grants were listed under the area of \"multi-themed\" rather than targeting a specific issue (see page 18 of their annual report). If they listed grant allocations more clearly we would be able to better dig into the efficacy of Comic Relief’s specific programs. It is also largely unclear what constitutes \"helped\" within each program area (e.g. what does it mean to support refugees or support women and girls?), and thus this lack of explicit data on outputs makes it hard to measure the cost-effectiveness of their grants. \n\nHowever, we can conduct a rough analysis of cost per beneficiary helped differentiated by their location. Comic Relief state that they intend to (and have previously) allocated funds evenly between their UK and international projects, so we start by assigning half of their total 2021 expenditure of £86.2m (see page 73 of their annual report) to each. \nIn the UK the beneficiaries supported in the past 2 years were 750k people experiencing financial and material poverty, 29k people experiencing domestic abuse, and 26k young people. This gives a total of around 400k UK beneficiaries annually, and gives us a rough cost estimate of £100 per person helped in the UK. Given the Gold Standard benchmark of £200 to avert one year of severe depression, this implies that, in order for the charity’s UK work to meet the Gold Standard, on average each beneficiary in the UK would have to experience a benefit at least as good as averting 6 months of severe depression.\n\nInternationally the beneficiaries supported in the past 2 years were 8.1m individuals. This gives us a total of around 4m international beneficiaries annually and a rough cost estimate of around £10 per person helped internationally. This implies that the international work would meet the Gold Standard if, on average, each beneficiary experienced a benefit at least as good as averting around 15-20 days of severe depression. \n\nHowever, we anticipate that the true costs are somewhat higher, given that Comic Relief provides grants to organisations that likely have other sources of funding and therefore outputs may be double-counted. These costs per beneficiary also don’t consider what would have happened otherwise if Comic Relief had not made grants to these organisations.\n\nGiven the low cost per person helped for their international programs it’s possible that Comic Relief’s international programs are cost-effective and competitive with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks but we would need to see explicit outputs in order to be able to judge this.\n\nFurther information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion of the work of Comic Relief would include:\n-  A complete list of organisations which received grants, their program area, the size of grants received, and the outputs (e.g. people helped) allocated to each organisation.\n- An assessment of the average amount of benefit received by recipients. For example, what does what \"helped\" mean in terms of mental health (e.g. is it access to an online forum or 6 weeks of CBT?) or in terms of children’s health (e.g. is it food packages or mother-to-mother support groups or nutritional workshops?).\n- The degree to which the organisations they give grants to would be able to continue operating without Comic Relief support, and what proportion of these organisations’ funds are met by other sources. \n- Additionally, given the size of their annual expenditure it seems reasonable to expect Comic Relief to use some of their resources to (a) demonstrate how their intervention is implemented similarly to other interventions already proven to work (e.g. in published academic research) or (b) undertake RCTs or econometric analysis that demonstrates their impact.\n-    A fuller analysis would also assess management capability. For example, this would involve assessing Comic Relief’s capabilities around Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (or MEL) to ensure that they are learning from their mistakes (and not simply publishing evaluation reports that don’t change anything), and understanding how the leadership sets strategy and selects projects; in particular, how the charity incorporates cost-effectiveness thinking into its strategic decisions.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Comic Relief as More Information Needed under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective\n- We have no indication of cost-effectiveness, or we do not judge those indications to be promising",
