  "description": "to fund\nmy Kenya Wildlife Education project which is about buying binoculars and books concerning\ndifferent types of mammals in Kenya. I will distribute these binoculars and books to schools,\nuniversities, colleges and wildlife and birds organizations in Nairobi, Kenya.\nOne reason for wanting to buy these books is because the teachings contained in these books\nare not taught in schools, colleges and universities. Due to this fact, many young people and\nadults do not know about the different mammals, and therefore are not able to choose careers\nthat will enable conserve these animals in the future. It is therefore important to buy these\nbooks for the above named institutions so that young people can have access to them. The\nknowledge they will gain will enable them to conserve these animals in the future.\nThe other reason for wanting to buy these books is because many people here in Kenya do not\nknow about mammals in Kenya. Because of this many people choose careers that pollute the\nenvironment and cause climate change. If Kenyans are taught about these mammals and the\ncauses that cause their numbers to decline, then they will choose conservation careers that\nwill protect these animals.\nI am therefore requesting your organization to provide me with 250 pounds so as to buy\nbinoculars and 10 different types of books and distribute them to 17 institutions that I have\nnamed above. I come from a very poor neighborhood and most people here cannot afford\nthese books and binoculars. I hope you will provide me with the funds I am requesting.",
