  "description": "MiracleFeet is on a mission to ensure every child can reach its solution.\nOver two million children live with the extreme consequences of a treatable birth impairment, known as clubfoot (or talipes equinovarus) that causes one or both feet to turn inwards and downwards. MiracleFeet is bringing the low-cost, nonsurgical standard of care, routinely provided in advanced health systems, to low-income countries. The solution is surprisingly inexpensive and results in full correction of the foot in four to six weeks.",
