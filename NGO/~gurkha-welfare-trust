  "recommendation": "**Gurkha Welfare Trust achieves a Bronze assessment under the SoGive rating methodology.**\n\nThe Gurkha Welfare Trust helps veterans (mainly based in Nepal) \"live with dignity\". It was originally set up to pay these beneficiaries a pension but now includes building residential homes, investing in the community, and natural disaster response.\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-sogive-approach-to-assessing.html), we consider two questions:\n\n- how much does it cost for the charity to do something\n\n- what is the thing (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)\n\n**More about what the Gurkha Welfare Trust does**\n\nBased on the information we have gathered from the 2019 accounts, the Gurkha Welfare Trust spent £7.5m on \"Individual Aid\" charitable activities. This includes paying 4,831 veterans and widows a pension, 406 grants to those caring for the elderly, and disability support for 227 people. \n\nGurkha Welfare Trust also spent £5.2m on providing medical aid (treating 73,500 cases), £4.5m on community aid for schools and water access, £1.2m in preparing for natural disasters, and £0.4m on building 103 earthquake-proof residential homes.\n\n**Benchmarking**\n\nHaving reviewed the Gurkha Welfare Trust under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process is to compare this to benchmark charities. These benchmark charities have strong cost-effectiveness and evidence for their effectiveness. For these benchmark charities, you should be able to achieve an outcome about as good as saving a life for around £1,500. An example benchmark charity is the [Against Malaria Foundation](https://app.sogive.org/#charity?charityId\u003dagainst-malaria-foundation)\n\nIn performing the comparison, we think of what a \u0027representative project\u0027 of the Gurkha Welfare Trust might look like i.e. to what activity a marginal pound donated would actually go to. Note that whilst \"Individual Aid\" is the largest component of the charity\u0027s work at the moment (35% as per the 2019 accounts), it is not clear that marginal funds will go there. This is because the veterans and widows supported are elderly and thus an ever-shrinking portion of beneficiaries.\n\nInstead, it is maybe more likely that additional funds will go to \"Medical Aid\" or \"Community Aid\", which saw the biggest year-on-year increases from 2018 to 2019. It is of course also possible that additional funds go to one of the other areas listed above, which may have a different level of impactfulness.\n\nIt is unclear how to assess \"Medical Aid\" and \"Community Aid\", as we only know these activities\u0027 outputs, not outcomes. If it costs around £70 per medical treatment and £32 to give a household access to clean water for a year, then £1,500 could fund around 20 medical cases or supply 45 households with water. However, we do not know how much these interventions increase life expectancy or enhance the quality of life. Thus it is difficult to compare this positive impact with saving a life.\n\nA similar issue exists with \"Disaster relief\", where spending is precautionary and so we do not know how many lives it will eventually save in the future. These three charitable activities make up over half of the Gurkha Welfare Trust\u0027s work and growing, so it is plausible that additional funds will be allocated there. Hence, this knowledge gap is critical.\n\nA better judgement can be made when looking at \"Individual aid\". If it costs around £1,540 for the Gurkha Welfare Trust to support a beneficiary for a year, then £1,500 can just about support one person. These beneficiaries are elderly and often have no other safety net, so this intervention is plausibly akin to saving a life. However, since the cost of this intervention is only for a year, it does not outperform or reach a Gold charity.\n\nOther charitable actives appear less cost-effective. Supporting a beneficiary with \"Residential Houses\" costs around £8,750. We believe that supporting a beneficiary through a care home is likely to be less positive an outcome than saving 5.8 people\u0027s lives. However, this intervention is a small component, making up less than 2.5% of charitable actives.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOverall, we are thus tentative to assess the Gurkha Welfare Trust as Silver-rated but more information is needed to be confident about this. The areas where it is most likely to expand to in the future (medical and community aid) have promising outputs but the actual outcomes for beneficiaries are unclear. Individual aid, the charity\u0027s currently largest component, is close to benchmark but other smaller interventions, like residential housing, are far from it.\n\nFor reference, when we describe a charity as Silver-rated, we mean that\n- we expect, but cannot prove, that the charity\u0027s work likely has a large positive impact\n- we have good reason to believe that the charity underperforms a Gold-rated charity (i.e. achieves less positive impact per pound donated than a Gold-rated charity), but highly outperforms a Bronze-rated charity.",
