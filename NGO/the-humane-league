They work to reform the way farm animals are treated while also inspiring people to make more compassionate food choices. Their strategy includes hard-hitting corporate campaigns and wide-ranging outreach and education programs, supported by an extensive network of organizations, activists and supporters around the world.",
  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**The Humane League is rated as More Information Needed (Promising) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- The Humane League (THL) is an international nonprofit and has been a registered charity in the UK since 2018. THL focuses its work on chicken welfare, and more recently on fish welfare, working through corporate outreach, campaigning, and volunteer engagement.\n- In the 2019/20 financial year, THL UK spent a total of about £0.68m on donor-funded charitable activities. The international THL network spent a total of $8.75m in 2020.\n- Within their activity areas, the outcomes of the corporate outreach programs can be quantified best. Animal Charity Evaluators estimates that THL programs between January 2019 and June 2020 affected 660 to 8,500 million animals. \n- Even if we use the lower bound of this estimate, this leads to costs of less than 1p per animal affected. Most of the quantified benefits relate to chickens, but promising initiatives also target fish. However, it is not straightforward to relate these costs directly to the Gold Standard benchmark of fully averting the suffering of one chicken living in very poor conditions.\n- We still feel that THL’s activities are very promising and likely cost-effective for promoting animal welfare. Some uncertainties remain around the benefits and cost-effectiveness of these activities.\n\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n\n**More about what The Humane League does - how they spend your donations**\n\nThe Humane League (THL) is an international nonprofit that seeks to improve the welfare of farmed animals. THL was founded in Philadelphia in 2005 and operates in the US, Mexico, the UK, and Japan. The organisation has been a registered charity in the UK since 2018. In the following, we distinguish the impact of the UK entity from the international operations of THL as much as possible.\n\nTHL UK focuses its work on chicken welfare, and more recently on fish welfare, working through corporate outreach, campaigning, and volunteer engagement.\n\nIn the 2019/20 financial year, THL UK spent a total of £682,805 on donor-funded charitable activities, according to their UK [annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA10657697\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d5103392) (AR). A more recent [annual report](https://assets.ctfassets.net/ww1ie0z745y7/3DIIU7xz585wscRUTQCTg2/448699b926200babbb4a9dc2479fda8c/THL-UK-2020-annual-report-final.pdf) for 2020/21 is also available, but does not contain any financial details.\n\nTheir international operations are much bigger, with $8.75m spending reported in their 2020 [US annual report](https://assets.ctfassets.net/ww1ie0z745y7/ESrq14Uj2S3Xlcr2OI4qD/6195a5068df5b781bbb77023f62c6e29/2020-annual-report-digital.pdf). The US organisation also provided the majority of THL UK’s income in 2019/20.\n\nTHL UK funds activities in the following strategic areas. The division of spending between these categories is not disclosed in the annual report for the UK.\n\n*Communications to increase public awareness*\n\nIn their communications initiatives, THL UK draws attention to animal welfare issues. In the financial period 2020/21, THL was mentioned in mainstream publications like the Daily Mail and The Guardian. They also communicate through their website and social media (annual report, p. 10). In late 2019, THL UK launched a Corporate Cruelty Awards program (annual report for 2019/20, p. 8).\n\nTo support fish welfare, THL UK launched a lobbying campaign in Scotland and England to regulate stunning parameters.\n\n*Building coalitions and momentum*\n\nCoalition-building and strengthening the animal welfare movement are strategic goals of THL UK (annual report, p. 4). THL International initiated the [Open Wing Alliance](https://openwingalliance.org/) (OWA), which forms an umbrella for 79 member organisations from 63 countries, with the goal of freeing egg-laying hens from cages.\n\n*Corporate outreach and public corporate campaigns*\n\nIn their annual report 2020/21, THL UK reports that they have secured 12 cage-free commitments and 26 broiler commitments, mostly in the UK and Europe, but including 3 global cage-free commitments (p. 7). Due to the pandemic, THL UK also targeted food delivery, and reports that it lobbied 19 meal kit companies to commit to the [Better Chicken Commitment](https://betterchickencommitment.com/) (BCC). It is not fully clear whether some of these commitments were achieved with the help of partnerships like the Open Wing Alliance. \n\nTHL UK does not report an estimate of the number of animals reached through these commitments. However, in the US annual report for the reporting period 2020, THL International mentions a milestone of 100 corporate commitments across the UK (achieved since the charity was set up) benefiting 30 millions chickens (p. 6).\n\nFor the period January 2019 to June 2020, [Animal Charity Evaluators](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/the-humane-league/) estimate that the international THL organisation, including their US operations, affects between 660 million and 8,500 million animals (assuming a positive effect that lasts for 15 years) with their corporate programs in this period across the world.\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does The Humane League compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nTo review the work of The Humane League under the two-question method, we analyse costs per output and compare this to SoGive’s Gold-standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5 to avert the suffering of one chicken who is living in very poor conditions) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work.\n\nIn our analysis, we draw upon the analysis performed by Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) in their [comprehensive review](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/the-humane-league/2020-nov/) of The Humane League in 2020. This includes a quantitative study of the outcomes of THL International and comparable animal welfare charities for a 15-month period from January 2019 to June 2020.\n\nACE reviews the cost-effectiveness of THL International in two areas: Movement building, and corporate animal welfare campaigns. For movement building, ACE looks at THL activities like organising 7 OWA summits, recruiting 26 new OWA member groups, and mobilising thousands of volunteers in the US and the UK. They assert that the cost-effectiveness of THL’s movement-building program \"seems much higher than the average cost effectiveness of other similar programs\" that they have evaluated.\n\nFor corporate commitments, ACE compares program spending of $5.8m with the estimated total number of between 660 and 8,500 million animals affected. Even if we take the lower end of the range, this results in costs of less than 1p per animal affected. Again, they find that the cost-effectiveness seems much higher than the average of other programs.\n\nThe cost of 1p per animal affected is likely significantly more cost-effective than the Gold Standard benchmark of £5 to avert the suffering of one chicken who is living in very poor conditions. However, there are a number of uncertainties or qualifications that would need to be addressed:\n- The degree of benefit of THL’s work in corporate outreach needs to be assessed in relation to the benchmark. Regarding food company pledges, for example, it is not even generally accepted that cage-free environments are better for hen welfare. In 2017, Open Philanthropy published a [report](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/farm-animal-welfare/how-will-hen-welfare-be-impacted-transition-cage-free-housing) on the impact of cage-free environments, where they admit uncertainty, but still conclude that \"the U.S. transition to cage-free housing systems will on net reduce hen suffering once mortality rates have stabilized\". Even if there are benefits, they might be smaller than fully averting suffering as referred to in the Gold Standard. However, based on an estimate of 1p per chicken, the benefit could be (£5 / £0.01p) 500 times smaller and still meet the Gold Standard.\n- The above assessments do not cover THL’s communications and public awareness work. Uncertainty remains over the cost effectiveness of these programs. In the US, THL also promotes diet change towards vegan diets, which does not (yet) seem to be a focus of the UK organisation.\n- The ACE report covers THL International, so we would need additional information to independently assess the cost-effectiveness of the activities of THL UK.\n- Corporate outreach programmes that aim for voluntary welfare pledges have been studied by ACE in 2014, but these reports have been archived after criticism in 2017-18. We would like to see new studies on corporate outreach interventions to judge the effects of these activities.\n- Incremental improvements in the living conditions for farmed animals seem to be a laudable outcome of animal advocacy groups. However, it can be argued that these improvements actually make society more comfortable with meat eating and hinder the achievement of more fundamental goals such as animal rights. There are also arguments that voluntary pledges lead to harmful \"co-optation\" between animal rights groups and food companies. \n\nACE views reducing the suffering of farmed animals as a high-impact cause area. In their 2020 assessment report, they rate the international THL organisation as one of four \"top charities\" and view THL as \"an excellent giving opportunity because of their strong, cost-effective programs, their robust track record of strengthening the movement, and their healthy organizational culture\".\n\nWhile some uncertainty remains, we still feel that THL’s activities are promising and likely cost-effective for reducing animal suffering. More information regarding the points outlined above would enable us to better judge the overall effectiveness of THL.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate The Humane League as More Information Needed (Promising) under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective\n- For a tentative rating, we may have no explicit charity-specific indicator of cost-effectiveness, or may have partial cost-effectiveness indicators\nWe may employ analytical judgement to determine what seems promising\n",
