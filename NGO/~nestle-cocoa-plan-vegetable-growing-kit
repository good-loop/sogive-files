  "description": "Poverty affects many cocoa-growing households in Côte d\u0027Ivoire. Over-reliance on cocoa makes some farmers vulnerable to global market price fluctuations. In order to increase and help diversify their income, Nestlé and the ***[International Cocoa Initiative](https://cocoainitiative.org/)*** engage women in vegetable growing. The funds are used to equip them with skills, tools, seedlings, and fertilizers in order to grow and sell plantains, rice, and/or peppers. Thanks for helping us make this possible!",
