  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**Kidney Research UK is rated as More Information Needed on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- Kidney Research UK funds and delivers research into kidney diseases,   improves treatments for people with kidney diseases and spreads awareness of kidney health.\n- Kidney Research UK did not provide sufficient information as to the costs of each program and therefore we were unable to determine their cost-effectiveness. In 2020/21 their total expenditure was £5.9 million across mainly research, but also awareness and education.\n- According to [Kidney Care UK](https://www.kidneycareuk.org/news-and-campaigns/facts-and-stats/) around 3 million people in the UK have Chronic Kidney Disease. People with Chronic Kidney Disease have a [substantially raised mortality risk and a reduction in health-related quality of life.](https://www.england.nhs.uk/improvement-hub/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2017/11/Chronic-Kidney-Disease-in-England-The-Human-and-Financial-Cost.pdf)\n- Overall, we think Kidney Research UK needs to provide more information for us to be able to compare them to our SoGive Gold Standard Benchmarks.\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what Kidney Research UK does - how they spend your donations**\n\nKidney Research UK’s [2020/21 annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA11337039\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d252892) indicates that their main charitable activities are funding research into kidney disease and spreading awareness and improving education about kidney disease and health.\n\nIn 2020/21 Kidney Research UK allocated 79% of their expenditure on charitable activities to research (giving £4.6m of non-project adjusted costs) and the remaining 21% to awareness and education (giving £1.2m of non-project adjusted costs). In their annual report they state that because of the Covid-19 pandemic they were unable to award as many research grants as usual but they ‘invested nearly £2 million over 15 projects and fellowships - five in partnership with the Stoneygate Trust’ ([annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA11337039\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d252892), p.8). Some examples of research funded in 2020/21 include: uncovering the genetic causes of inherited bladder problems in children; developing a virtual reality dialysis training tool; and understanding human cytomegalovirus infection in kidney transplant patients. More detailed information on the latest research grants made can be found [here](https://www.kidneyresearchuk.org/research/information-for-researchers/latest-awards/), for example an award for £187,000 made to Professor Giovanna Lombardi at Kings College London in January 2022 for a project titled: ‘Designing and manufacturing regulatory immune cells to reduce kidney injury and prevent kidney scarring’. In their ten year [research strategy](https://kidneyresearchuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Research-Strategy-Document.pdf) published in 2020, Kidney Research UK identify their immediate priorities as: transforming treatments to improve the quality of life for those with kidney disease; investigating how kidney disease affects those with multiple health conditions; highlighting and researching the health inequalities surrounding kidney disease. These seem like good priorities that will positively affect more disadvantaged groups. They also plan to involve patients in decision making and seek to partner with organisations to improve the pace of research as well as expanding their funding and support offered to researchers. In terms of the awareness and education projects, Kidney Research UK’s annual reports states that the awareness and education expenditure included ‘working with patients and raising awareness of kidney disease’ but gives no indication as to how this was delivered e.g. through leaflets, in-person consultations, or online adverts.\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Kidney Research UK compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of Kidney Research UK’s work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold rating, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nGiven Kidney Research UK’s total expenditure of £5.9 million their work would need to produce impact equivalent to over 1,100 lives saved or averting just under 30,000 years of severe depression in order for them to reach SoGive’s Gold Standard. This is plausible if their research uncovers improvements to treatments for kidney disease which wouldn’t have been discovered without their funding. Although they are a UK based charity, any scientific breakthroughs from research they have funded will also have implications worldwide for all sufferers of kidney disease. \n\nAs no information was provided in Kidney Research UK’s annual report on the measurable outcomes of their work, for example estimating how many lives had been improved due to a treatment they had funded, we were unable to compare them to our benchmarks. Previous SoGive [analysis](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2017/08/donating-to-medical-research-heres-why.html?q\u003dresearch\u0026view\u003dsidebar) found that in the UK, metabolic and endocrine research receives less funding than other diseases (especially cancer) when the global disease burden is taken into account. This suggests that within the field of medical research, donating to kidney research has the potential to have a greater impact than donating to fund research into other diseases. \n\nTo be able to compare Kidney Research UK to our benchmarks, further information would be needed and would include:\n\n- A more detailed financial overview including a breakdown of project expenditure. Although they do list the details of specific research grants awarded on their [website](https://www.kidneyresearchuk.org/research/information-for-researchers/latest-awards/) it is difficult to determine which financial year funds were allocated from as some awards are spread over more than one year e.g. for 36 months). We would also welcome greater detail on the projects conducted under their awareness and education expenditure.\n- Specific outcomes for each project. For example: how many lives are expected to be improved; the distribution of the specific disease they are researching; and/or how much that disease affects people’s quality of life. This would enable us to determine what the charity achieved within each project.\n- A breakdown of the amount of money partner organisations had contributed to the funding of research projects and as such what proportion of the outcomes should be credited to Kidney Research UK.\n- An analysis of the kidney disease funding landscape in the UK. This would enable us to determine what would happen if Kidney Research UK didn’t exist, i.e. what is the likelihood that the research would have been funded by another organisation and the same outcomes would have been achieved within a similar timeframe? Also, we should consider whether Kidney Research UK are more or less cost-effective at this research than other research organisations.\n- A fuller analysis would also assess management capability. For example, this would involve assessing Kidney Research UK’s capabilities around Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning to ensure they are learning from their mistakes, and understanding how the leadership sets strategy and selects projects; in particular, how does the charity incorporate cost-effectiveness thinking into its strategic decisions.\n\nFor more information on how we would conduct cost-effectiveness analysis of their research work if they provided more data on outputs under our 3 question method please click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-three-question-method-for.html?q\u003dresearch\u0026view\u003dsidebar)\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze ratings, click [here.](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Kidney Research UK as More Information Needed under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective\n- We have no indication of cost-effectiveness, or we do not judge those indications to be promising\n",
