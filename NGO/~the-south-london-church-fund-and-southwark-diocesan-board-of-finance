  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\nThe South London Church Fund and Southwark Diocesan Board of Finance (hereafter \"SDBF\") is rated as Not Recommended (firm) on the SoGive ratings scale.\n\n- SDBF provides church services to South London and East Surrey.\n- They provide this at a cost of approximately £370 per Christian practising at their churches.\n- While SDBF may provide some positive net impact to wellbeing, we believe this cannot come close to what is required to achieve a Gold Standard rating.\n- Based on this, we rate SDBF as Not Recommended (Firm) under the SoGive methodology\n\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n\n**More about what SDBF does - how they spend your donations**\n\nSDBF funds the operations of Church of England churches and church-based services in South London and East Surrey.\n\nIn 2020, their expenditure amounted to £23.9m. Contributions to purposes other than providing religious services to practising Christians are negligible ([Annual Report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA11014313\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d249678), pp. 44, 58, 60 \u0026 62). \n\nThis appears to be a typical year for their expenditure, which in 2019 totalled a comparable £20.7m (Annual Report, pp. 26 \u0026 44). The 2020 Annual Report cites 2019 church attendance numbers which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic forcing closures in 2020, is appropriate for our analysis. In 2019, they served 55,824 unique practising Christians with an average weekly church attendance of 38,213 (Annual Report, p. 14). For the year, they conducted 586 weddings and 2,450 funerals.\n\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does SDBF compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of SDBF under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nIn 2019, SDBF served practising Christians at a cost of approximately £370 per person (~£20m spent for 55,824 people). To reach the SoGive Gold Standard Benchmark (£200 to avert one year of severe depression), SDBF would have to provide a marginal improvement in well-being that is comparable to averting severe depression for approximately 1.85 years per church-goer (370/200). We do not consider this to be realistic, and by a considerable margin. While SDBF may provide some positive net impact to wellbeing for church-goers, we believe this cannot come close to what is required to achieve a Gold rating.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the above, we rate SDBF as Not Recommended (Firm) under the SoGive methodology.\n",
