  "recommendation": "What do they do? AMF provides funding for long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN) distributions (for protection against malaria) in developing countries.\n\nDoes it work? There is strong evidence that distributing LLINs reduces child mortality and malaria cases. AMF has conducted post-distribution surveys of all completed distributions to determine whether LLINs have reached their intended destinations and how long they remain in good condition. AMF\u0027s post-distribution surveys have generally found positive results, with some exceptions, but have some methodological limitations.\n\nWhat do you get for your dollar? We estimate that the cost to purchase and distribute an AMF-funded net is $4.53, or $4.29 excluding in-kind contributions from governments. The numbers of deaths averted and other benefits of distributing LLINs are a function of a number of difficult-to-estimate factors, which we discuss in detail below.\n\nIs there room for more funding? We believe that AMF is very likely to be constrained by funding. There is high uncertainty in the maximum amount that AMF could use productively, though we expect the maximum to be much greater than what AMF is likely to receive. To fund all of the distributions that it is currently in detailed discussions about, AMF would need $50 million more than we project it will receive. The total funding gap for LLINs for 2018-2020 appears to be hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\nAMF is recommended because of its:\n\n- Focus on a program with excellent evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.\n - Processes for ensuring that nets reach their intended recipients and monitoring whether they remain in homes and in good condition over the long-term.\n - Room for more funding - we believe AMF will be able to use additional funds to deliver additional nets.\n - Transparency - AMF shares significant information about its work with us and we are able to closely follow and understand its work.\n\nMajor open questions:\n\nWe have seen detailed data from before and during distributions. AMF also collects follow-up data after distributions. These follow-up surveys are conducted by AMF\u0027s various partner organizations and there has been variation in quality across locations. GiveWell has commissioned an ongoing project with IDinsight to better understand the survey methods used in several countries and to provide suggestions for AMF for the future.\nThe best evidence for nets was collected before they were widely used and there is some evidence that mosquitoes have since adapted to the insecticide used in nets, possibly making them less effective. It seems that insecticide resistance is a growing concern, but it remains difficult to quantify the impact of resistance. We will continue to follow several ongoing studies that may help to quantify the impact of resistance.1 We discuss this issue in more detail in our page on this topic.\n\nSource: GiveWell",
