  "recommendation": "\nNOTE: SEE NOTES ON THE SIDE FOR UPDATED DRAFT\n\n\n**Summary**\n \n**The Against Malaria Foundation is rated as Gold on the SoGive ratings scale**\n \n- The Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) provides funding for long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN) distributions for protection against malaria in developing countries.\n- GiveWell’s model indicate that the cost per life saved is 7,800 USD per life saved, or 5,900 GBP using a long term average exchange rate of 0.75 [1]\n- The cost per life saved equivalent, which also includes development benefits, is 5,100 USD or 3,900 GBP. [2]\n- This appears to be highly cost-effective, and is more cost-effective than the SoGive Gold Standard of £5,000 per life saved.\n- For this reason, it is likely that a donation to AMF will achieve at least as much positive impact as the same amount of money given to another Gold-rated organisation.\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n \nUnder the SoGive [two question method]( https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\nIn this review, we lean heavily on the [work done by GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf).\n \n**More about what AMF does - how they spend your donations**\n \nAMF provides long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (for protection against malaria) in bulk to other non-profit organisations or government agencies, which then distribute the nets in developing countries. AMF’s role in LLIN distributions is to:\n \n- Identify countries with funding gaps for LLINs.\n- Identify distribution partners (in-country non-profit organisations or government agencies) to carry out LLIN distributions. AMF and its partners agree on expectations for the distribution, including who pays for costs other than the purchase price of LLINs (which are always covered by AMF), the process that will be used to carry out the distribution, and what information will be collected and shared with AMF.\n- Identify which net types to use based on malaria prevalence, insecticide resistance, and price data.\n- Purchase LLINs and have them shipped to the distribution partners.\n- Work with distribution and independent monitoring partners to ensure that the agreed-upon process for the distribution is implemented, collect reports on the distribution, and conduct follow-up surveys.\n \n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does AMF compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of AMF under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here]( https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n \nThere is [strong evidence]( https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets) from randomised controlled trials that distributing LLINs reduces child mortality and morbidity from malaria. AMF conducts post-distribution surveys of completed distributions to determine whether LLINs have reached their intended destinations and how long they remain in good condition. AMF\u0027s post-distribution surveys have generally found positive results.\n \nIn our review of GiveWell’s analysis, we have explored the following areas:\n- we believe that GiveWell’s model of insecticide resistance doesn’t fully capture the relevant evidence\n- we have explored the implications of there being a malaria vaccine which is being rolled out, and concluded that this doesn’t materially change our conclusions.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze ratings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n \n**Conclusion**\n \nBased on the above, we rate the Against Malaria Foundation as Gold under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We believe that the charity’s work is effective. By effective we mean achieving positive as opposed to minimal or negative impacts.\n- We believe the charity’s cost-effectiveness competes with or outperforms the Gold Standard.\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n[1] Our source for the GiveWell cost per life saved is a straight (i.e. unweighted) average of the different countries modelled in [GiveWell’s 2023 v1 model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OnKTKE8x2KgJJqJBrZdTVBnX8kkobhR8FCw6RlBN_xM/edit#gid\u003d1364064522\u0026range\u003dB221:I221)\n[2] The cost per life saved equivalent was calculated using GiveWell’s moral weights (i.e. ways of calculating an equivalence between development benefits and lives saved). SoGive’s moral weights are slightly different, but actually quite similar to those used by GiveWell. The calculations were done in [this copy of GiveWell’s 2023 v1 model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JlFwCPPcSaTyGk-WKkckG7ScWMQfCHPs48SAC9wHWao/edit#gid\u003d1364064522\u0026range\u003dB234:B235).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------\nDELETE OUT THE BELOW\n\n\n**Summary**\n \n**The Against Malaria Foundation is rated as Gold on the SoGive ratings scale**\n \n- The Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) provides funding for long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN) distributions for protection against malaria in developing countries.\n- Based on GiveWell’s analysis, we believe that AMF’s malaria net distributions cost around £3,100 per life saved.\n- This appears to be highly cost-effective, and is more cost-effective than the SoGive Gold Standard of £5,000 per life saved.\n- For this reason, it is likely that a donation to AMF will achieve at least as much positive impact as the same amount of money given to another Gold-rated organisation.\n- However, we are aware of some uncertainties surrounding the effectiveness of LLINs. We are uncertain about how much weight to give to concerns around insecticide resistance, and the possibility of a vaccine. We also have some uncertainties around room for more funding. We are currently assigning AMF a tentative rather than firm Gold rating.\n \n**The SoGive approach**\n \nUnder the SoGive [two question method]( https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n \n**More about what AMF does - how they spend your donations**\n \nAMF provides long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (for protection against malaria) in bulk to other non-profit organisations or government agencies, which then distribute the nets in developing countries. Through 2020, AMF had supported large-scale distributions in eight countries (DRC, Ghana, Guinea, Malawi, Papua New Guinea, Togo, Uganda, and Zambia). AMF’s role in LLIN distributions is to:\n \n- Identify countries with funding gaps for LLINs.\n- Identify distribution partners (in-country non-profit organisations or government agencies) to carry out LLIN distributions. AMF and its partners agree on expectations for the distribution, including who pays for costs other than the purchase price of LLINs (which are always covered by AMF), the process that will be used to carry out the distribution, and what information will be collected and shared with AMF.\n- Identify which net types to use based on malaria prevalence, insecticide resistance, and price data.\n- Purchase LLINs and have them shipped to the distribution partners.\n- Work with distribution and independent monitoring partners to ensure that the agreed-upon process for the distribution is implemented, collect reports on the distribution, and conduct follow-up surveys.\n \nThe [annual report]( https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA10325467\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d4009810) for the financial year 2020 (ending June 30th) states that AMF spent a total of £49.3m ($64.3m) in 2020 (p.25). £47.2m ($61.6m) (96%) was spent on LLIN purchases, £1.7m ($2.2m) (3%) on distribution, monitoring and insecticide resistance research, and £0.5m ($0.65m) (1%) on overhead costs.\n \nIn the 2020 financial year, 4.4m LLINs were distributed, protecting 7.9m people (p.7). In total, AMF purchased [36.2m]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18tQ64_uolENkvzQdg7omYDmpmHGBaURqjfZVZZSKv48/edit#gid\u003d1833702421) LLINs in 2020. Relying on GiveWell’s [estimate]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16XOOB1oWse1ICbF0OVXUYtwWwpvG3mxAAQ6LYAAndQU/edit#gid\u003d1364064522) that each net covers on average 1.8 people, we should expect these nets to cover 65.2m people in the course of time.\n \n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does AMF compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of AMF under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here]( https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n \nThere is [strong evidence]( https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets) from randomised controlled trials that distributing LLINs reduces child mortality and morbidity from malaria. AMF conducts post-distribution surveys of completed distributions to determine whether LLINs have reached their intended destinations and how long they remain in good condition. AMF\u0027s post-distribution surveys have generally found positive results but have some [methodological limitations](https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf#Does_it_work).\n \nGiveWell [estimates]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16XOOB1oWse1ICbF0OVXUYtwWwpvG3mxAAQ6LYAAndQU/edit#gid\u003d1364064522) that in 2020 it cost around £3.85 ($5.02) for AMF to purchase, distribute and monitor delivery of a single LLIN to a household. This number includes the costs incurred by partner organisations, which make up 54% of the total costs. Furthermore, GiveWell estimates that it costs AMF £3,148 ($4,106) to avert a single death, which suggests that AMF outperforms SoGive’s Gold Standard of £5,000 per life saved.\n \nThere do remain some open questions about the effectiveness of AMF’s intervention. The best evidence for nets was collected before they were widely used, and there is some evidence that mosquitoes have since adapted to the insecticide used in nets, possibly making them less effective. It seems that insecticide resistance is a growing concern, but it remains difficult to quantify the impact of resistance. We will continue to follow several ongoing studies that may help to quantify the impact of resistance. GiveWell discusses this issue in more detail in [their page on this topic](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets/insecticide-resistance-malaria-control). We also note that [an effective new vaccine](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-56858158) against malaria could plausibly reduce the benefits obtained from using nets. However, this vaccine is still undergoing clinical trials and - even if confirmed to be highly effective - will likely not be widely rolled out for several years.\n \nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze ratings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n \n**Conclusion**\n \nBased on the above, we rate the Against Malaria\nFoundation as Gold (tentative) under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We believe that the charity’s work is likely effective. By effective we mean achieving positive as opposed to minimal or negative impacts. Our belief may be based on analytical judgement.\n- We believe the charity’s cost-effectiveness outperforms the Gold Standard.\n",
