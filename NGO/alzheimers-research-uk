  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**To assign a firm rating to Alzheimer’s Research UK under the SoGive rating methodology, we would need more information.**\n\n- Alzheimer\u0027s Research UK is a dementia research charity. They’re dedicated to understanding the causes of dementia and developing ways to prevent, treat and ultimately, cure all forms of the condition. They also engage in information and advocacy activities related to dementia\n- Without publicly available information about the charity’s contribution to the worldwide research effort or an estimated timeline for breakthroughs, we are unable to form an opinion about the cost effectiveness of Alzheimer’s Research UK\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what Alzheimer’s Research UK does - how they spend your donations**\n\nAlzheimer’s Research UK’s [2021 Annual Report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA11273708\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d3964458) outlines the details of the £31.2 million that they spent during their fiscal year.\n\nBased on the information we have gathered from their 2021 accounts, 81% of Alzheimer\u0027s Research UK’s charitable expenditure was dedicated to dementia research. This includes enabling scientists to publish research papers, a COVID-19 support fund to help projects get back on track after delays from lockdowns and helping people enrol in research studies. Approximately a decade ago, their ambitious target was to find a disease modifying treatment or cure for dementia by 2025.\n\nAlzheimer\u0027s Research UK also runs \"information and advocacy\" with the other 19% of funds. This includes their Think Brain Health campaign which reached millions to promote healthy lifestyles that reduce risk of dementia and campaigning the UK government via petition to honour its pledge to double investment in dementia research.\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Alzheimer’s Research UK compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of Alzheimer’s Research UK under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 to save one life, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nFor questions of systemic change, we utilize the SoGive three-question method, a special case of the two-question method:\n1. How much does it cost for the charity to perform the project?\n2. How much positive impact is achieved per year as a result of this change?\n3. How much sooner does the change occur as a result of this charity\u0027s work?\n\nTo answer question #2, we look at the impact of Alzheimer’s on those living with the disease as well as its mortality rate.\n\nThe latest [Global Burden of Disease study](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/gbd-2019-disability-weights) attempts to estimate the burden of diseases and injuries on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 equals a state of full health and 1 equals death. They indicate that Alzheimer’s disease ranges from a disability burden of up to 0.449 at the highest severity, where an individual has complete memory loss, no longer recognizes close family members and requires help with all daily activities. At moderate and mild severity there is a disability burden of 0.377 and 0.069 respectively. These numbers can be compared to a severe episode of a major depressive disorder (0.658) or a moderate major depressive disorder (0.396).\n\nThe World Health Organisation’s [dementia fact sheet 2021](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia) estimates that currently more than 55 million people live with dementia worldwide, and that this number will reach ~78 million in 2030 and ~139 million in 2050. Since we do not have information regarding the distribution of patients between severity levels, the range of disease burden from dementia is between 3.8 million to 24.7 million years of healthy life, and increases each year.\n\nWith regard to mortality, two applications from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study estimate that there were in the ballpark of [1.55 million](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.042236) to [1.62 milllion](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34337138/) deaths globally due to dementia that year.\n\nAs shown by the figures above, there would be an immense amount of suffering averted if the global research effort were able to successfully identify a treatment or cure. However, as noted in question #3, we also need to know how much the charity is influencing the estimated timeline for breakthroughs to evaluate their overall impact.\n\nSoGive would require the following additional information to answer #3 and build a cost-effectiveness model for Alzheimer’s Research UK:\n- How important the charity is to the global research effort, as a proxy for how much they influence the estimated timeline for breakthroughs. Alzheimer’s Research UK’s £17 million annual research spend is only a modest percentage of the worldwide effort. For example, the United States federal Alzheimer\u0027s and dementia research funding was $3.1 billion in 2020, so the charity constitutes less than 0.75% of global funding\n- An estimate for how long before the global effort produces a cure for dementia\n\nIf SoGive were to conduct a more in-depth analysis, we would want to conduct research to determine a best estimate for the above variables and determine whether the charity has any structural advantages that may accelerate a breakthough more effectively than other dementia research efforts. For example, we could ask experts in the field about the charity’s importance to the worldwide research effort. If there were reason to believe that the charity were particularly influential on the field of Alzheimer’s research as whole, we may assign them higher importance. However, without this information, we are unable to form an opinion about the cost effectiveness of Alzheimer’s Research UK’s research funding.\n\nSimilarly, this also applies to the minority of their charitable spend on information and advocacy activities. We would also need to consider counterfactuals: e.g. if Alzheimer\u0027s Research UK successfully persuaded the government to spend more money to support people suffering from neurological diseases, what would that money have achieved if they had not successfully redirected the funds?\n\nIn conclusion, we could not gather enough information to perform a detailed analysis or form opinions about Alzheimer’s Research UK’s work under the SoGive methodology.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt is not clear what the marginal benefit is of the marginal pound donated to Alzheimer\u0027s Research UK. For us to be able to say that Alzheimer’s Research UK is as cost-effective as one of our benchmark charities, they would need to show that donating to them would achieve an outcome as good as averting one year of severe depression per £200 or saving a life per £5,000 spent. Based on our judgement, there is insufficient evidence based on their publicly available accounts to make this claim.\n\nFurther information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion of the work of Alzheimer’s Research UK would be an estimate for how much the charity is accelerating progress toward breakthroughs through their funding and improvements to the research environment for the disease.\n",
