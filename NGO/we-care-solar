      "stories": "\"For everything you do, you need light\" explained Ugandan midwife Esther Madudu. \"You need to wash, clean and disinfect ... and there\u0027s no light. You postpone what you\u0027re doing. If you have a cervical tear, you must postpone until tomorrow. It is so painful to postpone the procedure until tomorrow.\" Without reliable electricity, midwives struggle to provide life-saving care by kerosene lanterns and flashlights. Doctors rush to finish emergency c/sections before they lose power. Health providers live in fear of nighttime deliveries, knowing they may not be able to treat complications if the sun is down\"",
