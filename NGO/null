  "description": "At the intersection of transportation and maternal healthcare, Moving Health found a massive gap in emergency care and locally made solutions. Geographically neglected areas often find themselves without any realistic, sustainable form of emergency transportation. Their mission is to fill this gap, by making sure every family is confident that they will be connected to healthcare when they need it most.",
