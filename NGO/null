  "extendedDescription": "On average, young women take home around 22% less than young men. Young women are more likely to be doing unpaid caring work, like caring for children or younger siblings. So they are more likely to be in part-time jobs, not able to get enough hours or to progress or not working at all.\n\n      \nYoung women have been hit especially hard by the rising cost of living and are more likely than young men to be struggling to make ends meet. This is because young women were already earning less to start with.\n      \n\n\"Young Women’s Trust stands up for equality for young women in the UK.
