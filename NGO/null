  "description": "The Human Expression (T.H.E) Dance Company was founded in 2008 by Artistic Director Kuik Swee Boon. Rooted firmly in Singapore yet universal in its perspective, T.H.E\u0027s contemporary dance works reveal the body as a medium for exploring and celebrating the human condition.\n\nDance artists at T.H.E are immersed in the Company\u0027s signature methodology, HollowBody, which guides them to access their deeper instincts and impulses through movement. The Company\u0027s movement vocabulary is distinct in its intensely personal aesthetics, yet thrilling in its diversity.\n\nT.H.E has performed at many major festivals, including the Singapore Arts Festival, Esplanade’s da:ns festival and Huayi - Chinese Festival of Arts, SIDance Festival and Seoul Performing Arts Festival in South Korea, Beijing and Guangdong Dance Festival in China, Niigata International Dance Festival in Japan, Les Hivernales Festival in Avignon, France, as well as Italy’s Oriente Occidente Festival in Rovereto, Inteatro Festival in Ancona, Cross Festival in Verbania, and Fabbrica Europa in Florence.\n\nBased on its vision of contemporary dance as a medium for nurturing human potential, T.H.E has also initiated numerous platforms like its semi-professional wing, T.H.E Second Company, as well as cont·act Contemporary Dance Festival to engage young artists and the wider public.",
