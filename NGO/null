  "description": "GreenKayak is an environmental NGO that engages volunteers in the fight against environmental pollution while kayaking. \n\nWe offer everyone to jump aboard a GreenKayak and paddle for free under two simple conditions:\n\n* Spend your time on the water collecting waste.\n* Share this experience on your social media using #GreenKayak.\n\nSince 2017, tens of thousands of people have paddled our stable double-sit-on-top GreenKayaks in the harbors, rivers, and lakes of five European countries, and collected more than 42 tons of trash. Think about how big a plastic bag is and how much it weighs, now imagine the pile of waste collected - itâ€™s a waste-mountain!",
