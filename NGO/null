  "description": "The Prince\u0027s Trust is a charity in the United Kingdom founded in 1976 by Charles, Prince of Wales. They aim to help young people aged 11 to 30 who are unemployed and those at risk of unemployment because they have struggled at school. They want to bring young people together from different backgrounds, cultures and faiths, so that they can make a positive difference in their communities. The Prince\u0027s Trust provides practical support, enabling young people to overcome their problems and get their lives on track. This is done by delivering programmes and basic financial support, which help young people to develop the confidence and skills they need to get a job or start a business.",
