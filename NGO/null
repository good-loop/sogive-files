  "description": "Art UK, the online home for art from every\npublic collection in the UK. Previously called Public Catalogue \nFoundation, they are a not-for-profit organisation working\nwith 3,000 public collections, the BBC and other partner \norganisations to showcase the art the UK owns. Much of\nthis art is not on public view and is now shown online for\nthe first time.\n\nArt UK already features 200,000 oil paintings from museums,\nuniversities, hospitals and other civic buildings across the\ncountry. They are now expanding the project to include\nthe UKâ€™s sculptures and as many other artworks as they can.\nThere are many ways to contribute to the project, but above\nall Art UK is for everyone who wants to see art, visit art and\ndiscover the stories behind the art.",
