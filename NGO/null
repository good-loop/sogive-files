  "description": "Our Seas Our Future is a 100% volunteer-run and non-profit marine conservation organisation based in Aotearoa/New Zealand.\n\nWith nationwide operations, OSOF operates based on a volunteer-driven model, focusing on coastal and marine conservation, environmental education, and community engagement projects.\n\nThe idea that gave rise to the OSOF initiative still drives us today; we are all stewards of our marine environment, and how we treat our environment now will shape the world we are living in tomorrow; the health of our seas is intertwined with our future.",
