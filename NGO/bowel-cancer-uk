  "recommendation": "**Bowel Cancer UK is rated as Not Recommended (firm) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- Bowel Cancer UK: provides expert information and support to patients and their families; campaigns for early diagnosis and access to best treatment and care; supports and funds research to help people stop dying of bowel cancer; educates the public and professionals about the disease.\n- According to their [annual report](https://bowelcancerorguk.s3.amazonaws.com/about_us/Bowel_Cancer_UK_Annual_Report_2020.pdf) Bowel Cancer UK’s expenditure in 2020 was £4.1million and [43,000 people](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/bowel-cancer) in the UK are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year.\n- Given the nature of Bowel Cancer UK’s programs-ancillary to the NHS’s work, and largely non-medical- it appears highly unlikely that Bowel Cancer UK’s cost-effectiveness will come close to the Gold Standard Benchmark of the equivalent of saving one life for £5000 and therefore we rate Bowel Cancer UK as Not Recommended (firm).\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what Bowel Cancer UK  does - how they spend your donations**\n\nAccording to their 2020 Annual Report, Bowel Cancer UK:\n-  Spent £1.2m on Awareness and Direct Services which accounts for 47% of their project-specific expenditure. This includes running their online forum, website, publishing awareness booklets and leaflets, having volunteer-led awareness talks at workplaces and community groups, and advising ITV soap \"Emmerdale\" on their bowel cancer storyline.\n- Spent £980k on Communications and Campaigning which accounts for 39% of their project-specific expenditure. They contributed to a consultation which ultimately resulted in NICE approval for a new combination of the usage of two drugs to benefit advanced bowel cancer patients in the UK. They also worked on providing consistent guidance and support to people with cancer during the coronavirus pandemic, and published a Never Too Young report where over 1,200 people shared their experience of bowel cancer in younger people.\n- Spent £360k on Research Grants which accounts for 14% of their project-specific expenditure. These grants are aimed at improving the prevention, early detection and treatment of bowel cancer. Their current research projects (funded by this and previous year’s expenditure) can be found [here](https://www.bowelcanceruk.org.uk/research/our-research/current-research-projects/). \n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Bowel Cancer UK compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of Bowel Cancer UK’s work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold rating, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert 1 year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\n*Awareness \u0026 Direct Services*\n\nThe non-project adjusted costs (e.g. assigning a proportional amount of fundraising and support costs to each arm of Bowel Cancer UK’s programs) of their Awareness \u0026 Direct Services were £1.9m in 2020, so to reach the SoGive Gold Standard this expenditure would need to provide benefits equivalent to over 350 lives saved or averting over 9,500 years of severe depression. The main output of this program was the 5,000 active users of their forum which aims to provide advice and support to help navigate the complexities of treatment for bowel cancer patients (see page 8 of their annual report). Whilst undoubtedly valuable to those suffering from bowel cancer it seems unlikely that usage of the Bowel Cancer UK forum results in an outcome as good as the alleviation of 2 years of severe depression for each user. \n\nThey also report other outputs such as providing covid advice on their website (66k views), running a Facebook support group (1000 members), printing awareness materials and patient information booklets (circa 190k printed and 30k downloads), volunteer-led bowel cancer awareness talks (475 attendees) and running a National ColorRectal Nurses digital get together (150 attendees) (all numbers taken from page 12 to 14 of their annual report). The bowel cancer storyline on Emmerdale was unfortunately cut short due to covid, and although it reached 6 million viewers there is no evidence as to what actions this may have caused viewers to take (and it’s also unclear as to what level of influence Bowel Cancer UK had in determining whether or not this storyline was ultimately written). Although these activities provide meaningful value to those using them, given the wealth of online information (including on the NHS website) surrounding bowel cancer (bowel cancer is the 4th most common cancer in the UK) it is highly unlikely to provide value equivalent to alleviating over 9,500 years of severe depression, even when combined with the forum usage. More detailed impact evaluation by Bowel Cancer UK on the impact of these services and information on the behaviours and wellbeing of those using them would be welcomed.\n\n*Communications and Campaigning*\n\nThe non-project adjusted costs of their Communications and Campaigning activities were £1.6m in 2020, so to reach the SoGive Gold Standard this expenditure would need to provide benefits equivalent to over 300 lives saved or averting nearly 8,000 years of severe depression. Their main outputs in this program were the 1000 extra bowel cancer tests ordered as a result of their collaboration with Bowel Screening Wales as part of their \"Do the Test\" campaign (page 12 of their annual report). Given the incidence of bowel cancer in those aged 60-74 (those able to \"do the test\") is [2.7%](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/bowel-cancer/incidence#heading-One) the best case scenario is an extra 27 lives saved. This is ignoring any further calculations about survival rates, the length of life saved,  and what would have happened otherwise if those individuals had taken the test at a later date, which would downgrade this estimate further. \n\nAnother key output was securing the approval for a new combination of the usage of two drugs to benefit advanced bowel cancer patients in the UK (see page 20 of their annual report). Given that this approval was the result of consultation with the clinical community, charities, and patients affected by the decision, it’s hard to understand what proportion of this success is attributable to Bowel Cancer UK, but it will certainly be less than 100%. The approved treatment extends life for advanced bowel cancer patients for circa 3.5 months. Bowel cancer results in 16.5k deaths annually in the UK  so the best case scenario is that everyone who dies of bowel cancer gets an extra 3.5 months of life (assuming everyone is eligible for the treatment). This is equivalent to an extra 4,700 years of life saved which is equivalent to roughly 155 lives saved (if life saved \u003d 30 years) whilst still assigning Bowel Cancer UK 100% credit for the change in recommendations. Additionally, as the NHS will now be spending more funds on providing this drug, there will be an opportunity cost of decreased funding for other treatments in the NHS (and therefore a reduction in net lives saved as people suffering from other diseases face reduced treatment options). Further, there should be some consideration as to the quality of life saved; it seems unlikely that the quality of 4,700 years worth of 4 extra months saved for someone with advanced bowel cancer is equivalent to providing 4,700 years worth of an extra 50 years of healthy(ish) life saved for a child or infant.\n\nTaking the very best case scenarios of the above two outputs (circa 180 lives saved) this gives a cost per life saved of around £9,000 and is still well below the SoGive’s Gold Standard benchmark of £5,000 per life saved meaning this part of Bowel Cancer UK’s programs is not sufficiently cost-effective to be recommended.\n\n\nOther outputs included their work with 49 other cancer charities as part of One Cancer Voice to provide consistent guidance and support to people with cancer during the pandemic (page 16 of their annual report), and their campaign for the one million ‘missed opportunities’ for bowel screening due to coronavirus to not be forgotten (page 19 of their annual report). The impact of their work with other cancer charities e.g One Cancer Voice and World Cancer Day may be small as this work would likely have continued without them, and the outputs. Bowel cancer screenings across the UK resumed in the Autumn of 2020 and Bowel Cancer UK themselves appear to take little-no credit for this outcome. They also published a Never Too Young report where over 1,200 people shared their experience of bowel cancer in younger people (page 18 of their annual report), but it is yet to be seen what impact on policy this will have. As such these outputs provide no extra evidence of Bowel Cancer UK’s Communications and Campaigning program meeting the Gold Standard benchmark.\n\n*Research*\n\nThe non-project adjusted costs of their Research program was £580,000 in 2020, so to reach the SoGive Gold Standard Benchmark this expenditure would need to provide benefits equivalent to over 100 lives saved. Their current [research strategy](https://bowelcancerorguk.s3.amazonaws.com/Research/P684%20BOW%20Research%20Strategy_LR.pdf) is focused on improving early detection bowel cancer screening, understanding and identifying people at high risk of bowel cancer, gaining a better understanding of bowel cancer in the under 50s, and ensuring best treatment and care for all. Given the small proportion of their funds allocated to research we haven’t conducted in-depth analysis of the impact of their spending and it’s cost-effectiveness. \n\nHowever, we do have an estimate of the impact of cancer research in general. A [QALY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year) (quality-adjusted life year) is a measure used to represent the length of life saved for a person adjusted to reflect the quality of life, and one QALY is equivalent to one year of life in perfect health. Earlier analysis by SoGive on [Cancer Research UK](https://app.sogive.org/#charity?charityId\u003dcancer-research-uk) estimated the cost per QALY gained at £1,600. This number, which is based on total UK spending on cancer research and the resulting effect on disease burden, cannot account for specific research projects funded by Bowel Cancer UK which may be particularly cost-effective. Still, taking £1,600 per QALY gained as a starting point, cancer research seriously underperforms SoGive’s Gold Standard, if we assume that one year of severe depression averted is comparable to one QALY gained, for which the Gold Standard benchmark of cost-effectiveness is £200.

This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective)\n- We do have some indication of cost-effectiveness, and have very high confidence that cost-effectiveness underperforms the Gold Standard, likely by a substantial margin",
