  "description": "Turning Point Scotland helps with learning disabilities, substance misuse, mental health, criminal justice, and homelessness. The charity [tailors](https://www.turningpointscotland.com/about-us/) its services to each individual served.",
  "recommendation": "**Turning Point Scotland achieves a Bronze assessment under the SoGive rating methodology.**\n\nTurning Point Scotland serves people who are at risk of becoming isolated in society. \n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-sogive-approach-to-assessing.html), we consider two questions:\n- how much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- what is the thing (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\n**More about what Turning Point Scotland does**\n\nTurning Point Scotland spent roughly £34 million in the 2018/19 financial year.\n\nThe charity spends 52% of charitable expenditures on helping with learning disabilities. The [tailored help](https://www.turningpointscotland.com/what-we-do/learning-disability/) can take 24 hours a day or just a short time.\n\nTurning Point Scotland directed 24% of charitable expenses towards homelessness. The charity provides [transitional housing](https://www.turningpointscotland.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Annual-report-FINAL-1.pdf) for people.\n\nThe charity used 10% of charitable expenditures on reducing substance misuse. Turning Point Scotland practices a philosophy of [harm reduction](https://www.turningpointscotland.com/what-we-do/substance-misuse/), reducing the negative consequences of substance misuse through safer use, managed use and abstinence. \n\nTurning Point Scotland spends another 10% of charitable funds on improving the justice system. The charity makes interventions at the time of arrest, also providing a women-only service in and out of prison.\n\nFinally, the charity spends 4% of charitable expenses on mental health issues. For people suffering from mental issues, [the charity](https://www.turningpointscotland.com/what-we-do/mental-health/) can arrange employment opportunities, provide living housing support, organize therapeutic gatherings, and help maintain tenancies.\n\nBased on the information we have gathered from the 2018/19 accounts, we understand that on average, helping one person would cost about £4,400. \n\n**Benchmarking**\n\nAfter a review of the work of Turning Point Scotland under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing the organization to benchmark charities. These benchmark charities have strong cost-effectiveness and evidence for their effectiveness. A benchmark charity should achieve an outcome about as good as saving a life for around £1,500. Example benchmark charities include the [Against Malaria Foundation](https://app.sogive.org/#charity?charityId\u003dagainst-malaria-foundation) (AMF).\n\nIf helping one person would cost about £4,400, then with the same amount of money, a benchmark charity would have achieved an outcome as good as saving about 3 lives. We see providing one person with help related to learning disabilities, homelessness, substance misuse, legal advocacy, or mental health as a less positive outcome than saving 3 lives. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe conclude by giving Turning Point Scotland a Bronze rating under the SoGive two-question method.\n\nFor reference, when we describe a charity as Bronze-rated, we mean that\n- we expect, but cannot prove that the charity\u0027s work likely has a positive impact\n- we have good reason to believe that the charity underperforms a Silver-rated charity (i.e. achieves less positive impact per pound donated than a Silver-rated charity)\n",
