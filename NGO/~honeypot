  "extendedDescription": "Honeypot believes in providing early intervention support to children at a young age in order to prevent issues and challenges that arise in a young person’s life becoming deep rooted.\n\nTo achieve the most for young carers, they work in partnership with a wide spectrum of organisations that provide complementary skills. To be most effective, Honeypot must sit within the child’s welfare network and respect each child’s individual situation. Over many years, Honeypot have successfully built a network of working relationships with over 130 referring organisations, including social workers and GPs, local authorities, head teachers and school welfare officers to ensure that young carers who need our support are referred to us.\n\n",
