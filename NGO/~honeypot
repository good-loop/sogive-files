  "description": "Honeypot is the only UK charity to provide a consistent level of support for young carers in the 5-12 age range. In the UK nationwide, they give young carers a break from demanding and stressful responsibilities at home and provide a safe, nurturing environment where children at risk can develop their full potential.\n\nOfficial figures suggest there are 195,000 young carers in the UK, but it is more than likely there are many more from families that do not come forward or others being misrepresented - a BBC survey in 2018 estimated the number could be as high as 800,000. Young carers can find it hard to relate to their peers, struggle to concentrate in school and have little time to play with friends and take part in after-school activities. ",
