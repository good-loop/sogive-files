  "description": "Since 1996 Honeypot has been working to enhance the lives of young carers aged 5-12 years by providing respite breaks and on-going outreach support. In the UK nationwide, they give young carers a break from demanding and stressful responsibilities at home and provide a safe, nurturing environment where children at risk can develop their full potential.\n\nOfficial figures suggest there are 195,000 young carers in the UK, but it is more than likely there are many more from families that do not come forward or others being misrepresented - a BBC survey in 2018 estimated the number could be as high as 800,000. Young carers can find it hard to relate to their peers, struggle to concentrate in school and have little time to play with friends and take part in after-school activities. ",

  "extendedDescription": "Honeypot believes in providing early intervention support to children at a young age in order to prevent issues and challenges that arise in a young person’s life becoming deep rooted.\n\nTo achieve the most for young carers, they work in partnership with a wide spectrum of organisations that provide complementary skills. To be most effective, Honeypot must sit within the child’s welfare network and respect each child’s individual situation. Over many years, Honeypot have successfully built a network of working relationships with over 130 referring organisations, including social workers and GPs, local authorities, head teachers and school welfare officers to ensure that young carers who need our support are referred to us.\n\n\n",
