  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**CALM is rated as More Information Needed (promising) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- CALM aims to prevent male suicides through increasing awareness about men’s mental health and providing webchat and helpline services for people struggling.\n- According to the [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/suicidesintheunitedkingdom/2020registrations) in 2020 the number of suicides in UK was 5224, 75% of which were male. \n- According to their [annual report](https://www.thecalmzone.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AR-20-21-A4-Digital.pdf) CALM’s total expenditure in 2020/21 was £4.8m. They spent £4m on charitable activities, while £0.8m was spent on fundraising (page 44).\n- CALM’s Helpline Service slightly underperformed our Gold Standard in 2020/21 but in 2019/20 and 2018/19 respectively this service tentatively met our Gold Standard.\n- CALM’s Helpline Service seems very promising, especially considering the service’s cost per life saved statistic in the previous years. More information, especially on why their cost-effectiveness varied between 2018-2020, is needed to confidently determine whether CALM’s impact approaches our Gold Standard.  \n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what CALM does - how they spend your donations**\n\nCALM, or Campaign Against Living Miserably, is a charity based in UK that aims to prevent suicides. As they state in the \"About\" section of their [website](https://www.thecalmzone.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AR-20-21-A4-Digital.pdf), in the UK 125 people commit suicide every week, and in 2020 more than 75% of UK suicides were male. Men in the UK are three times more likely to commit suicide compared to women, and even though their services aren’t exclusively for men, CALM mainly focuses on preventing male suicides and highlights the gender ratio of suicides. The following data is collected from their [2020/21 annual report](https://www.thecalmzone.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AR-20-21-A4-Digital.pdf):\n- CALM’s main service is a helpline and webchat service which accounts for 62% of their expenditure on charitable activities (p.50) (non-project-adjusted expenditure on this category was £3m). This service is aimed at anyone who feels depressed and seeks help, regardless of the severity of their situation.\n- CALM also reports their outreach and promotion efforts, which constitutes 37% of their expenditure on charitable activities (p.50) (non-project-adjusted expenditure on this category was £1.8m). Because of COVID-19, CALM had to cancel some events and most of their campaigns and events took place online. They ran social media campaigns, shot a short film with Joe Marler, launched brand partnerships with companies such as Head \u0026 Shoulders, and expanded their ambassadorship program\n- CALM has no other direct services, but they also gave £20k to Support After Suicide Partnership Programme in 2020/21 (page 38 of the annual report), an initiative that aims to provide support to people bereaved by suicide through research, signposting and directing people to local support channels. \n- It should also be noted that in 2020/21 CALM had unrestricted reserves of around £5.3m (page 38 of the annual report), which is under the threshold SoGive considers too rich, but is somewhat higher than is typical for a charity and should be monitored to ensure CALM is able to effectively deploy any extra funds raised. \n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does CALM compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of CALM’s work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold rating, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert 1 year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\n*Helpline and Webchat Services*\n\nAs stated above, CALM’s main programme is the Helpline and Webchat Service they provide. The non-project adjusted costs of the programme in 2020/21 was £3m. According to page 34 of their [annual report](https://www.thecalmzone.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AR-20-21-A4-Digital.pdf), they responded to 57% of the call and chat requests and they prevented 472 suicides. Besides the number of suicides prevented, and number and percentage of contacts answered, no other metric or data is given showing how has this service has impacted the well-being of the users. Compared to previous years, in 2020/21 CALM has spent more money and achieved less output. In 2019/20 CALM’s non-project adjusted expenditure was spent £2.2m (p.44) and they responded to 73% of the contact requests and prevented 646 suicides (p.34). In 2020/21 they saw a 9% increase in contact requests, they mainly attribute this increase to COVID and the economic and social hardships caused by it. Although this increase in contact requests might partially explain the decrease in their response ratio, it doesn’t explain the decline in the number of suicides they prevented. CALM also aims to leverage new technologies to improve their helpline service. Through Project RIO, they are utilising machine learning and artificial intelligence to increase their capacity, extend their service hours to 24/7, and improve user experience and overall efficiency. This year they launched a chatbot called Qbot as the first product of Project RIO on the CALM website.\nIf we focus on active rescues and don’t consider other well-being improvements attributable to this service, CALM prevents a single suicide for a cost of around £6,400. Their cost-per-suicide-averted number for this service was much lower in the preceding years, according to page 27 and 41 of their [2019/20 annual report](https://www.thecalmzone.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CALM-Annual-Report-2019-2020.pdf) their non-project adjusted cost per active rescue was around £3,300. The same statistic for [2018/2019](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA9914540\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d4013290) (p.6 and p.12) gives a value of around £1,500. One plausible reason for the decrease in this service’s cost-effectiveness  could be the coronavirus pandemic, because they might have faced certain funding bottlenecks and organisational problems, although according to their annual report (p.44) the amount of funds raised actually increased rather than decreased, and the number of calls increased compared to previous years (p.34)\n\nTo fully understand the benefits of the helpline we need to understand what CALM defines as an active rescue and how they measure the number of suicides prevented, they answer these questions on page 34 of their [annual report](https://www.thecalmzone.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AR-20-21-A4-Digital.pdf): \"The number of known suicides prevented by helpline and webchat workers are reported internally. These are calls or chats in which the caller has been actively suicidal,with the threat of imminent suicide and where the helpline worker believes that the caller has stepped back from suicide or where CALM has successfully enabled emergency services to respond.\"\n\nIn order to meet the SoGive Gold Standard, a charity has to provide benefits equivalent to saving a single life for £5,000, and CALM’s helpline service slightly underperforms the Gold Standard. However, the impact of their helpline service isn’t limited to suicide prevention, there are other well-being improvements attributable to this service. It’s not currently possible to estimate what these well-being improvements amount to, as no data is available on whether users were satisfied with ther service or had increased well-being, making it challenging to calculate an accurate cost-effectiveness figure, since this isn’t a service exclusive to people who are at risk of suicide or severely depressed. Their [website](https://www.thecalmzone.net/help/get-help/) states that this is a service open to people who \"feel down\", regardless of how severe their mental condition is. CALM could do more to measure the impact of the helpline on general mental health, through the use of surveys (although this may be challenging due to anonymity requirements by users of their helpline) or the citation of studies on the efficacy of help-line style services on the mental health and wellbeing of its users. For example the Samaritans, who also provide a helpline service for those suffering from mental health problems, are able to provide greater detail on the wider wellbeing impact of their services. Although they are a larger and significantly more established organisation, this shows that this type of quantification is possible. You can view the SoGive analysis of Samaritans [here](https://sogive.org/#charity?charityId\u003dsamaritans).\n\n\n*Outreach and Promotion*\n\nNon-project adjusted costs for their outreach and promotion efforts in 2021/21 was £1.8m. To reach the SoGive Gold Standard, expenditure for these efforts would need to provide benefits equivalent to over 350 lives saved or averting around 9,000 years of severe depression. CALM partnered with high-profile organisations and created content through various mediums. They created playlists in collaboration with Spotify, partnered with EA and designed a kit for FIFA, adding certain features to the game.\n\nAlthough CALM’s main initiative is their helpline, they also provide information and advice through their website. For example, their website has a section named CALM Guides, in which they provide problem-specific guidelines for people struggling with a certain problem, such anxiety, financial Stress etc. In 2020/21 their website was visited by 830k users, and their social media posts garnered 23m impressions and finished the year with a total social media audience of 220k (p.34 of their annual report). Although this online presence and outreach efforts are important because of the probability that they increase the number of people using CALM’s helpline service, there are many other online resources on mental health, so the counterfactual impact and marginal benefit per pound of these efforts might be low.\nIt seems like CALM has increased the visibility of and awareness around the issue of male suicides. Changes in attitudes and views surrounding mental health and male suicides in UK can be measured through surveys, but in order to estimate CALM’s cost-effectiveness and success, we would need to estimate what proportion of this impact can be attributed to CALM, and what proportion of changes in attitudes is caused by other organistaions/events etc. Regardless, it remains difficult to estimate how an advert on TV or a certain feature added to a video game changes attitudes or increases awareness, but CALM could still do more to assess whether these initiatives actually increase awareness or not. For example they could collect data by putting up widely used mental health questionnaires on their website, or conduct or analyse surveys themselves. \n\nFor more information on how we would conduct cost-effectiveness analysis of their lobbying and campaigning work if they provided more data on outputs  under our 3 question method please click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-three-question-method-for.html?q\u003dresearch\u0026view\u003dsidebar)\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze ratings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate CALM as More Information Needed (Promising) under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do have some indication of cost-effectiveness, and see the possibility that cost-effectiveness matches or exceeds the Gold Standard, but this depends on further data and analysis.",
