  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**To assign a firm rating to Ark under the SoGive rating methodology, we would need more information. Our tentative rating for the charity is Not Recommended.**\n\n- Ark is an education charity that aims to make sure that all children, regardless of their background, have access to a great education and real choices in life\n- The majority of their spending in 2020 went toward Ark Ventures, which incubates, launches and scales ventures that share their mission\n- The only venture with publicly available metrics for us to form an impact assessment, representing just 6% of charitable expenditure, is Now Teach, which helped people in the UK change professions to teaching at an average cost of Â£10,264 per individual, which we judge to have a lower cost-effectiveness than our benchmark charities\n- 70% of their spending is on UK education, which does not typically meet the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks\n- If we had more information about the work of Ark, the charity would likely achieve a Not Recommended assessment under the SoGive rating methodology\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charityâs cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what Ark does - how they spend your donations**\n\nArkâs [2020 annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA11018611\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d3996816) outlines the details of the Â£22.5 million that they spent in 2020.\n\nThe charity spent 70% of charitable funds on UK programmes. Examples of initiatives in this category included Ark Curriculum +, which partnered with over 600 school subject departments to improve teaching standards in Mathematics and English, and Ark Start, an affordable nursery programme for disadvantaged preschool children which opened two nurseries in 2020/2021. \nThe charity spent 10% of charitable funds on the construction of EdCity, an educational hub in London that contains schools, housing, a public square and offices for organizations including Ark. Finally, they spent 6% of total funds on Now Teach, a now discontinued initiative that helped 140 people change professions to teaching.\n\nArk directed another 23% of funds to international education, divided between the Education Partnerships Group (EPG) (15%), Global Schools Forum (GSF) (4%) and Others (4%). The EPG supports governments in low- and middle-income countries (like Cambodia, Cote\ndâIvoire, Ghana, Sierra Leone and South Africa) to make sure that all children have a high-quality education. GSF works with non-state educational organizations in developing countries. They run or support 30,000 schools who provide quality education to over 5 million children.\n\nIn the past, the charity also funded many other ventures which are now separate legal entities disconnected from Arkâs finances.\n\nAll of Arkâs ventures are targeted toward education, but the charity does not articulate what ultimate outcomes the charity is aiming to achieve through education. Are they intending to enable individuals to reach higher incomes later in life, or do they value education for its intrinsic value? If the former or some other extrinsic goal, Ark did not provide any evidence about the extent to which that goal was achieved.\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Ark compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of Ark under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGiveâs Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as saving a life for Â£5,000, or Â£50 to double someoneâs consumption (spending) for one year) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\n*Ark ventures*\n\nAccording to the charity\u0027s [website](https://arkonline.org/ark-ventures/what-makes-an-ark-venture), Ark ventures need to meet several criteria. First, they need to have the potential and ambition to reach a national scale. We think that this is a good element of their criteria, assuming that the organisations incubated by Ark ventures do more good per pound invested than the alternative use of those funds. Secondly, Ark ventures need to demonstrate potential financial sustainability, which typically means that the grantee needs to provide a chargeable service or that a government would provide the necessary funding. If the venture is sustainable by providing a chargeable service, under SoGiveâs criteria we would consider whether philanthropic funding is the best way to fund this work. For example, equity investment may be an alternative. Ark also expects their ventures to have innovative ideas, a clear business plan, strong leadership, and the willingness to collaborate with the Ark team and other Ark ventures. Finally, Ark claims that Ark ventures should aim to solve intractable issues in education. Under SoGive\u0027s criteria, intractable issue areas typically lead to less impact per pound donated. Other criteria we would expect include the neglectedness of the intervention. For example, if something is being done by lots of people, itâs less likely that the new venture will do much more good.\n\n\n*Now Teach*\n\nThe only Ark venture with publicly available metrics for us to form an impact assessment, representing just 6% of charitable expenditure, is Now Teach, which helped 140 people in the UK change professions to teaching, at a total of Â£1,437,000 spent. This comes out to Â£10,264 per individual. In order for it to meet the SoGive Gold Standard, we would have to believe that the difference between the impact that these individuals would have as teachers would be much greater than the impact that they would have in their current or alternative profession. Additionally, we would have to believe that the difference in impact is sufficiently large to warrant the cost, which could double 200 peopleâs consumption for a year if directed at a charity that meets the SoGive Gold Standard. According to their [website](https://nowteach.org.uk/am-i-eligible-to-teach/), Now Teach is a competitive programme that is looking for professionals who can contribute valuable skills and experience, demonstrated by evidence of career success such as management and leadership positions. Since their recipients are in high leverage careers, and are likely to have an above average social conscience, there may be a loss in some of their potential positive impact if they were to switch to teaching earlier or at all because of the charityâs help, although they would contribute to resolving the teacher shortage. If SoGive were to conduct a more in-depth analysis, we would want to evaluate the extent to which this is the case. Because of this reason as well as the high average cost per individual, if Now Teach were standalone we would likely not consider it a recommended charity.\n\n*Other UK programmes*\n\nOutside of Now Teach, we do not have sufficient information about the costs and impacts of the initiatives that Ark funds. For the other UK programmes, we do not have the breakdown of funds between initiatives, nor the number of individuals impacted by their schools and nurseries. However, based on our UK schools analysis, funding spent on UK education does not typically meet the SoGive Gold benchmarks. On average Â£6,000 is spent each year per student in England, while one of the SoGive Gold benchmarks is saving a life for Â£5,000. Since saving a life seems to be better than providing one extra year of education, education spending in the UK would not usually meet the SoGive Gold benchmark, unless there was a particular reason to believe that a particular education charity achieved substantially more good per pound donated than is normal for this sector. Moreover there is some evidence for diminishing returns on education spending, so extra donations to schools are likely to be less cost-effective than the initial school spend.\n\n*Outside of the UK*\n\nFor EPG, a sizable part of their focus is on research, which we would assess through the SoGive 3 question method. We know that GSF provides education to over 5 million children, but do not know what percentage of their funding comes from Ark since according to their [website](https://www.globalschoolsforum.org/page/PolicyandPartnerships), they receive either normative guidance or combinations of financing and technical support from organisations such as UN agencies, donor agencies, and the World Bank. Much of EdCity\u0027s value lies in allowing educational institutions to operate close to one another, but we would need more evidence to support how much value this creates.\n\nOverall, we could not gather enough information from the 2020 annual report and venture websites to perform a detailed analysis or form opinions about Ark\u0027s work under the SoGive methodology.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTentative rating: If we had more information about the work of Ark, the charity would likely achieve a Not Recommended assessment under the SoGive rating methodology. 70% of their spending is on UK education, which does not typically meet the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks. Furthermore, we are relatively confident that one of Ark\u0027s ventures--Now Teach--possesses lower cost-effectiveness than our benchmark charities.\n\nFor tentative ratings, our rating is more prone to change in light of new information. Further information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion of the work of the charity would involve:\n(a) a more detailed cost assessment of the beneficiary organizations of Ark. How much did each program cost, and how much did Ark contribute? \n(b) more comprehensive impact assessments, both in quantity and depth\n\n\n",
