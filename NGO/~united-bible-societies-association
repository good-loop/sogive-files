  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**The United Bible Societies Association is rated as More Information Needed on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- The United Bible Societies Association’s (UBS) objective is \"to promote, in the interests of the public benefit, the widest possible effective distribution and use of the Bible or any parts thereof throughout the world, including the translation into any language or languages, printing and publication of the Bible or any part of the Bible\".\n- Based on its 2020 annual report, the cost of the charitable activities to UBS was £40.7M.\n- For this annual cost, a Gold-rated organisation would be expected to save about 8k lives, or avert one year of depression for over 200,000 people. \n- We are sceptical that UBS is achieving an outcome as good as this. Nevertheless, further information about the effect on well-being of accessing the Bible would be needed to formally estimate the cost-effectiveness of UBS, and compare it with the above benchmark of a Gold-rated organisation.\n\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n\n**More about what UBS does - how they spend your donations**\n\nThe principal means by which UBS meets its objectives is \"in supporting the work of Bible Societies who together constitute UBS Fellowship\". This \"operates in more than 240 countries and territories around the world\", and has the mission of achieving \"the widest possible, effective and meaningful distribution of the Holy Scriptures, and helping people interact with the Word of God\".

Information about the number of people impacted by UBS’ activities could not be found. However, it is mentioned that UBS supported the Bible Societies \"in progressing toward the goals set in the Translation Roadmap: to complete 1,200 translations within 20 years at a cost of about USD $500 million to make God’s Word accessible to 600 million people\". This implies that the average cost to make \"God’s Word\" accessible to one person should be about £0.60. Nonetheless, it is not clear how much of the Translation Roadmap’s target budget of $500M was supposed to come from UBS rather than individual Bible Societies or other organisations. \n\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does UBS compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of UBS under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nFor UBS’ total annual expenditure of £40.7M, a Gold-rated organisation would be expected to save about 8k lives (£40.74M / £5k \u003d 8.1k), or avert one year of depression for over 200,000 people (£40.74M / £200). We are sceptical that UBS is achieving an outcome as good as this. Nevertheless, further information about the impact of UBS’ charitable activities on the beneficiaries would be needed in order to formally estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. \n\nBesides the target average cost to make the Bible accessible to one person of £0.60 (see previous section), information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion would be:\n- Theory of change for UBS’ indirect work (grants, consultancy and services to the Bible Societies), including an assessment of the extent of its own impact. It would be important to understand how cost-effective the Bible Societies would be without the intervention of UBS. This involves some challenges, as we have pointed out in an earlier [analysis](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/is-it-better-to-fund-direct-work-or.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n- Knowing how many of the 600M people targeted by the Translation Roadmap would actually access the Bible. For example, in countries where Christianity is not widespread, the vast majority of the population might not want to access the Bible, even if it is accessible.\n- Evidence regarding the effect on well-being of accessing the Bible based on adequately powered studies, preferably using a robust approach such as randomised controlled trials. These should also assess the long-term impact of the intervention, and take into account the method via which the Bible is accessed. For example, the impact from reading the Bible at home might be different from that of going to Mass. Such studies should also consider what would have otherwise happened - UBS presumably hope that access to the Bible will lead to religious conversion to Christianity. Thus, we would want evidence of the typical impact of this compared to converting to another religion (or none at all). We do not expect this to be addressed from a theological perspective, but rather by drawing on psychological evidence around wellbeing, happiness, and mental health. UBS provides no such evidence.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate the United Bible Societies Association as More Information Needed under the SoGive methodology. \n",
