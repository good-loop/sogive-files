I\u0027ve had a very difficult time health-wise as I had pneumonia 3 years in a row.\n\n\"Last year was a very hard time as I had nowhere to live and no job, and I wasn\u0027t very knowledgeable about benefits.\n\n\"I was really struggling - my stress levels were high and my immune system almost non-existent. I was spending months staying with friends and was eating whatever I managed to get, like sandwiches and leftovers. I needed help. The nurse at hospital mentioned The Food Chain and what it does and I said \u0027that sounds brilliant\u0027 - I\u0027d never heard of it before.\n\n\"As I had stomach and bowel problems, The Food Chain provided me with different options for my diet and sent me recipes that really worked for me.\n\n\"The Food Chain was a lovely experience right from the very beginning - the positive energy of all the staff comes through with every phone call.\n\n\"I started to recover and feel stronger, and have gained weight. I\u0027ve started working again; my life has turned around.\n\n\"It was a blessing to have grocery services like The Food Chain. It comes every week and you can ask for what you want and it gets delivered - who else does that? There are no services like this where I come from, and I didn\u0027t expect this kind of help when things got difficult.\n\n\"I don\u0027t have enough words of praise for the Food Chain. It gave me a helping hand that pulled me out of misery. It said \u0027here is food\u0027 when I was hungry.\"",
