  "description": "Action for children is an UK charity focused on disadvantaged children and families. With a team of staff and volunteers they provide help in the form of online and in person parenting support, they help young people with a risk of developing mental illness, they support children in foster care and also help parents with mental health issues.",
  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n**Action for Children is rated as More Information Needed on the SoGive ratings scale**\n- Action for Children is a UK-based charity that provides a wide range of services to disadvantaged children including mental health and careers support, advice to parents, children’s centres, and fostering.\n- According to their [2020/21 annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA11224651\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d4000625), they state that they have reached over 250,000 children and parents directly and provided information to 350,000 additional parents, while spending £139 million. This means they spend an average of £230 per person reached.\n- However, as we have little information on the precise make-up, nature, and effects of their support it is not currently possible to perform cost-effectiveness analysis on their activities.\n \n**The SoGive approach**\n \nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n \nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what the Action for Children does - how they spend your donations**\n Action for Children’s [2020/21 annual report]( https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA11224651\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d4000625) indicates that they divide their spending between four main areas: best start to life (£31.8 million), which includes running children’s centres and providing early years support; disabled children’s services, such as providing specialist support and short breaks (£31.2 million); mental health and chance to thrive (£36 million), which includes therapy and careers support; and safe and stable homes, which covers parenting support and helping move children into safe home environments (£34.4 million).\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Action for Children compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nTo review the work of Action for Children under the two-question method, we analyse costs per output and compare this to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £200 per year of severe depression averted, or £50 to double someone’s consumption (spending) for one year) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar)\nIn 2020, Action for Children spent £139 million and claim to have reached 255,000 children, young people, or their families and provided information to 350,000 more parents online. This comes out at an average cost of £230 per person/family reached. Thus, to reach the SoGive Gold Standard, this support would need to provide very large wellbeing benefits equivalent to one year of severe depression averted or increased future earnings equivalent to five years of doubled consumption.\nUnfortunately, we currently lack the required information for judging how Action for Children compare to our benchmarks as we do not have the exact breakdowns of their expenditure on each service provided, how many children are reached by each service, and what impacts those services have.\nTo reach a firm assessment, the following information is required:\n- Robust evidence indicating the average effect of their different programmes on the people reached by Action for Children’s activities, such as the extent to which they succeed in making children happier and safer.\n- Furthermore, we would want to explore the quality of evidence obtained by Action for Children in any impact evaluation provided and would assess whether we believed the programme or project was effective. This means reviewing whether their projects have achieved the goals which Action for Children claims are relevant for that project, e.g. children’s wellbeing, or their success in finding a productive career. We would then consider the methodology Action for Children used to evaluate the project and decide whether it is sufficiently robust to support any claims about the project’s true impact. This could involve establishing whether the project was implemented on the basis of robust evidence and reasoning found in the academic literature, or Action for Children undertaking a high-quality assessment for themselves, such as a randomised controlled trial.\n- More detailed information regarding the breakdown of their project costs, including on how much they spend on each type of support provided alongside information how many people are reached by said support.\n-  A fuller analysis would also assess management capability. For example, this would involve assessing Action for Children’s capabilities around Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (or MEL) to ensure that they are learning from their mistakes (and not simply publishing evaluation reports that don’t change anything), and also understanding how the leadership sets strategy and selects projects; in particular, how the charity incorporates cost-effectiveness thinking into its strategic decisions.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the above, we rate Action for Children as \"More information needed\" under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n-  We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective.\n- We have little indication of cost-effectiveness.\n",
