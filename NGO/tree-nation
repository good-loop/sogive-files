  "stories": "\nTree-Nation was founded in 2006 by Maxime Renaudin. From one single project in the driest and poorest country on earth, Niger, the project quickly evolved to help local teams of planters around the world.\n\nTree-Nation has been constantly innovating and is the creator of many tools that are now commonly used by other NGOs in our sector. In particular Tree-Nation invented the virtual tree, then the online forest and many other software tools in order to provide a unique technological solution aimed at breaking the distance between remote projects and their sponsors in developed countries.\n\nRecognized internationally and becoming an official partner of the UNEP in 2007, Tree-Nation has evolved to help +4000 companies and +200,000 users to plant more than 7 million trees in more than 30 reforestation projects on 6 continents.",
