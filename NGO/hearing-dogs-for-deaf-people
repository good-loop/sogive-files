  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**Hearing Dogs for Deaf People is rated as Not Recommended (firm) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- Hearing Dogs for Deaf People trains dogs that provide company to deaf people and helps them in certain everyday situations, i.e. alerting them to the sound of alarm clocks, doorbells, ringing phones, and in emergencies, fire alarms.\n- Adjusting for non-project costs the charity spent approximately £48,000 per dog trained in 2020/2021.\n- Hearing Dogs for Deaf People claims that hearing dogs can save lives by alerting deaf people in case of emergencies when they can’t hear the usual alarms. However, we believe such life-saving situations are very rare, and in any case assuming each dog saves 1 life during its lifetime, the cost of £48,000 is still significantly higher than the SoGive Gold Standard of £5,000 per life saved. \n- The charity claims that the company of hearing dogs has profound positive effects on the mental health and well-being of deaf people but it is not clear that the mental health benefits of owning a hearing dog are significantly greater than owning an ordinary animal. In any case, using the Gold Standard of averting a year of severe depression for £200 (assuming each dog has 11 years of service) each dog would need to provide benefits equivalent to averting the severe depression of over 20 individuals during every year of the dog’s life for it to meet SoGive\u0027s Gold Standard benchmark which seems highly unlikely.\n- We rate Hearing Dogs for Deaf People as Not Recommended (firm) on the SoGive ratings scale.\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what Hearing Dogs for Deaf People does - how they spend your donations**\n\nOur main source of information for this section is the charity’s [annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA11414397\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d293358) for the year ending 31 March 2021.\nWe also checked their annual reports from the two previous years, and their main activities and costs incurred training dogs seem to have remained broadly similar, and we can expect them to remain similar in the following years too.\n\nThe majority of the charity’s work consists of the training of specialised hearing dogs. The full training of a hearing dog takes 18-24 months, and beyond the work of many volunteers, it also requires the work of professional dog-trainers. Matching the recipients to the right dogs also takes work, and even after the training ends, the charity keeps in touch with the beneficiaries and supports them in handling the animal. \n\nIn 2020, the charity completed the training of 182 hearing dogs and 150 employees worked on the supply, training, and welfare of the animals and on the continued aftercare with the recipients. The charity spent £7 million on training these 182 hearing dogs and providing them to deaf people and a further £1.7 million on fundraising and management (page 25 of the annual report). \n\nIn 2017, Hearing Dogs for Deaf People merged with a smaller charity, [Hearing Link](https://www.hearinglink.org/about-us/our-work/), who help people affected by hearing loss connect with each other. They produce self-help materials and organise some events, but their main activity seems to be maintaining a help-desk providing support and advice to people affected by hearing loss. The help-desk received 1,769 enquiries during last year.\n\nIt should be noted that the expenditure allocated to Hearing Link’s services is £280,000, which is just 3% of the total annual expenditure, thus it is more important for us to focus on the charity’s main mission of training hearing dogs to assess its overall cost-effectiveness.\n\n\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Hearing Dogs for Deaf People compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of Hearing Dog for Deaf People’s work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold rating, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nThe charity spent approximately £48,000 per dog trained in 2020. For this money, each dog  would need to provide benefits equivalent to saving 9 lives or to averting severe depression of over 20 individuals during every year of the dog’s life in order to reach SoGive’s cost-effectiveness benchmarks. It’s clear that the benefits provided don’t come close to these numbers.\n \nHearing Dogs for Deaf People claims that hearing dogs can save lives by alerting deaf people in case of emergencies when they can’t hear the usual alarms. However, we believe such life-saving situations are very rare, and even if we very generously assume that every hearing dog saves one life,  the cost is still significantly higher than the SoGive Gold Standard of £5,000 per life saved. We also believe there are cheaper technical solutions for most problems in which the specially trained hearing dogs can help (i.e. flashing light as doorbell, vibrating alarm clock on the wrist)\n\nThe charity claims that the company of hearing dogs has profound positive effects on the mental health and well-being of deaf people. This might be true, but it’s important to compare the benefit of hearing dogs to what would have happened without the charity’s assistance. We believe that animal-loving deaf people who apply for the charity’s assistance can also buy or adopt not specially trained dogs, and it is not clear that the mental health benefits of owning a hearing dog are significantly greater than owning an ordinary animal.  The SoGive Gold Standard for providing benefits equivalent to averting a year of severe depression is £200, which sums up to £2,200 over the dog’s 11 year of service. This implies that even by extremely generous assumptions (assuming that every recipient is severely depressed, the ownership of a hearing dog completely averts their depression, and a less professionally trained dog wouldn’t help in their condition), the training cost of  £48,000 still well exceeds SoGive’s efficiency benchmark, therefore Hearing Dogs for Deaf People’s intervention of training hearing dogs, whilst valuable to those involved, can not be considered cost-effective.\n\nVery little information could be found about the exact activities of the recently merged Hearing Link, but as it is only a minor fraction of the charity’s total spending, we can assume that the effectiveness of a pound donated to Hearing Dogs for Deaf People is best represented by their main project, the dog-training.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze ratings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Hearing Dogs for Deaf People as Not Recommended (firm) under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective\n- We do have some indication of cost-effectiveness, and have very high confidence that cost-effectiveness underperforms the Gold Standard, likely by a substantial margin.",
