  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**Keep Britain Tidy is rated as Not Recommended (Firm) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- Keep Britain Tidy works on projects relating to waste, the environment, and public spaces in the UK.\n- We find that Keep Britain Tidy spends about £160 to enable one volunteer to improve local public spaces, or about £440 to give an award recognizing a high-quality public space.\n- We think that our Gold-rated charities reliably do more good per pound donated, so we do not recommend donating to Keep Britain Tidy.\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what Keep Britain Tidy does - how they spend your donations**\n\nKeep Britain Tidy runs a variety of programs relating to waste, the environment, and public spaces. They work with corporate, governmental, and philanthropic organizations on local and national projects, which may change from year to year. During the 2019-20 financial year, Keep Britain Tidy’s top three areas of expenditure were awards, community engagement, and campaigns. We will briefly discuss each of these program areas.\n\nKeep Britain Tidy gives out awards to recognize high-quality public spaces, such as the Green Flag Award for parks and the Seaside Award for beaches. In the past year, Keep Britain Tidy spent about £1 million on these award programs, which was about 20% of their overall spending. They held three award ceremonies, presenting a total of over 2,000 awards.\n\nKeep Britain Tidy organizes and supports volunteer efforts to improve local public spaces and waterways. Volunteers have cleaned up litter, participated in citizen science projects, and worked on removing invasive species of plants. Keep Britain Tidy also organizes corporate volunteering events. In total, over 5,500 volunteers worked on Keep Britain Tidy projects in the 2019-20 financial year. During this time, Keep Britain Tidy spent about £900,000 on volunteering and community engagement programs. \n\nKeep Britain Tidy runs and supports campaigns to raise awareness of litter and waste issues. In the past year, they launched a campaign on the topic of dog fouling, and supported the Department for Environment, Food \u0026 Rural Affairs’ \"Keep it, Bin it\" campaign on the topic of litter. They also run an annual campaign called the Great British Spring Clean, which encourages communities to run litter-picking events for their local public spaces, although this year these events were ultimately canceled due to Covid-19. In total, Keep Britain Tidy spent about £800,000 on campaigns during the 2019-20 year. \n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Keep Britain Tidy compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of Keep Britain Tidy’s work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as averting one year of severe depression for £200, or doubling someone’s consumption for one year for £50) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nKeep Britain Tidy aims to reduce waste, clean up litter, and improve public spaces. Clean, well-cared-for public spaces are more pleasant to be in, which may directly make people happier. Also, better parks and other outdoor spaces may encourage people to spend more time outdoors, get more exercise, and feel more connected to their community, which can improve physical and mental health. We will consider how cost-effectively Keep Britain Tidy achieves these goals, compared to Gold-rated charities with related goals such as improving mental health.\n\nKeep Britain Tidy’s award programs do not directly improve public spaces; instead, they encourage local authorities to improve their own public spaces, to the extent that the local authorities appreciate these particular awards. Possibly, each of the 2,265 public spaces that were given an award was motivated to make an improvement, but note that improvement is not a requirement for an award - the award may simply recognize public spaces that were already high-quality. In the 2019-20 financial year, Keep Britain Tidy spent over £1 million on its award programs, and recognized 2,265 public spaces; therefore, they spent about £440 per public space recognized. For about the same amount of money, a Gold-rated organization could avert two years of severe depression, or double the consumption of a person in poverty for nine years. Even if each Keep Britain Tidy award represents an improvement in a public space, we think that the typical improvement to a public space in the UK does not do as much good as averting two years of severe depression. \n\nWithin volunteering and community engagement, Keep Britain Tidy spent about £900,000 during the year, and 5,562 volunteers worked on projects to improve their local public spaces. Therefore, it costs about £160 for Keep Britain Tidy to enable one volunteer to contribute to a project, such as picking up litter or surveying wildlife. For about the same amount of money, a Gold-rated organization could avert nine months of severe depression, or double the consumption of a person in poverty for three years. We think that one volunteer contributing to a public space project is unlikely to be able do a similar amount of good. \n\nSince we think that our Gold-rated charities do good more cost-effectively than Keep Britain Tidy’s top programs, we do not recommend donating to Keep Britain Tidy at this time.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Keep Britain Tidy as Not Recommended (Firm) under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective.\n- We do have some indication of cost-effectiveness, and have very high confidence that cost-effectiveness underperforms the Gold Standard, likely by a substantial margin.",
