  "recommendation": "**PDSA is rated as Not Recommended (Tentative) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\nPDSA provides subsidised veterinary care to sick or injured pets and promotes responsible pet ownership. They operate a network of 48 pet hospitals in the UK. \n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-sogive-approach-to-assessing.html), we consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)\n\n\n**More about what PDSA does**\n\nPDSA, originally the People\u0027s Dispensary for Sick Animals, provides free or low-cost veterinary services to sick and injured pets such as dogs, cats and rabbits. These services are available to pet owners who cannot afford regular service, determined through defined eligibility requirements such as Housing Benefit or Income Support. The owners also need to live near the hospitals or clinics. \n\nVeterinary services are provided through a network of 48 pet hospitals in the UK, in combination with smaller pet clinics and \"PetWise\" mobile-care vehicles. The services also include preventive treatment such as neutering. \n\nIn the financial year 2018/19, PDSA helped 438,170 pets with 2.7m veterinary treatments according to their [annual report](https://www.pdsa.org.uk/media/10723/pdsa-2019-annual-report-accounts.pdf) (AR), see pages 5 and 24. They claim this saved the lives of 265 pets per day (AR p. 13) or a total of 96,725 pets in the reporting period.\n\nTo fund their activities and to reach pet owners, PDSA runs 124 high street shops and an online shop.\n\nIn addition, PDSA provides education on animal health and welfare as regards to pets. They inform owners about animal needs in the areas of behaviour, environment, companionship, diet, and health, based on the UK Animal Welfare Acts. \n\nEducation is delivered through school and community programmes. Examples include pet First Aid courses and the digital information platform [Pet Health Hub](https://www.pdsa.org.uk/phh), which was accessed about 480,000 times in 2019 (AR p.12). In 2019, PDSA said they reach over 100,000 children each year through workshops and digital packages such as the PetWise School Award.\n\nFinally, PSDA campaigns for the recognition of animal’s needs and the benefit they bring to their owners through activities such as Animal Awards, programmes on national TV (The People’s Vet), and the PDSA Animal Wellbeing Report.\n\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis**\n\nTo review the work of PDSA under the two-question method, we analyse costs per output and compare this to SoGive’s Gold-standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5 to avert the suffering of one chicken who is living in very poor conditions, or £200 for averting severe depression for one year) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\nIn the 2018/19 financial year, PDSA spent a total of £66.1m on donor-funded charitable activities, according to their [annual report](https://www.pdsa.org.uk/media/10723/pdsa-2019-annual-report-accounts.pdf) (AR). 89% of this cost (£58.7m) is used for treatments and the rest for education and prevention.\n\nTo assess the positive impact of PDSA’s work, we first focus on treatments. The charity reports that they reached 438,170 pets with 2.7m treatments, resulting in an average of about 6 treatments per pet. Through these, they saved the lives of 96,725 pets. For the sake of this argument, we equate saving one pet’s life with averting suffering for 10 chickens. We also assume half of the remaining pets receive a benefit that is as big as averting suffering for one chicken. In this way, PDSA creates a benefit that we equate with averting suffering for just over 1.1m chickens. \n\nBased on this calculation, we turn to PDSA’s expenditure of £58.7m for treatments. This is now equivalent to about £52 per chicken, which is much higher than our Gold benchmark of £5. \n\nWe can also quantify the positive impact on the pet’s owners. For this, we consider pets’ lives saved. We believe few owners will end up with depression  as a consequence of their pet dying, though many will feel a sense of loss (which they would have to face eventually, anyway, as most pets die before their owners). However, let us make the generous assumption that 10% of the owners whose pets were saved would have developed severe depression for a year. That results in 9,673 years of severe depression averted at a total cost of £58.7m (as above), resulting in costs of £6,068 per year. As above, this is much higher than the Gold Standard benchmark of £200 for averting severe depression for one year. \n\nEven the combined positive effects are not enough to warrant a classification among the Gold-rated charities.\n\nThere remains some uncertainty about the positive influence of education, campaigns, and prevention. The impact of these activities is less tangible and we have not analysed it in detail. In any case, less than 12p of each pound donated to PDSA goes to these areas.\n \n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate PDSA as Not Recommended (Tentative) under the SoGive methodology. The tentative rating reflects the uncertainty in the moral weighting of the life of a pet. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective\n- We do have some indication of cost-effectiveness, and believe that cost-effectiveness underperforms the Gold Standard, likely by a substantial margin\n",
