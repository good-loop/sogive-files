[The charity](https://youngminds.org.uk/about-us/reports/our-impact-reports/) works to ensure access to mental health care for young people, provides support for parents and carers, and campaigns within schools and the mental health system.",
  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**YoungMinds is rated as More Information Needed on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n- YoungMinds is a charity that aims to provide; resources, tools and direct support to young people who are struggling with their mental health; tools and resources for parents and teachers to help and empower young individuals to look after their mental health\n- Their annual total expenditure in 2020/21 amounted to £5 million (p.25 of their annual report), £4.07 million of which was spent on charitable activities.\n- Young Minds’ feedback questionnaires indicate high satisfaction and improved well-being for most of their projects, but most of their projects’ impact are measured only through feedback questionnaires, and information received via this method is too vague to warrant a rigorous impact evaluation.\n-Overall, we think that more information is needed in order to properly determine if YoungMinds is having an impact per pound donated that reaches the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks.\n\n\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\n\n\n**More about what Young Minds does -  how they spend your donations**\n\n\nYoung Minds has three core programmes: Never Alone, Someone to Turn To, and Powerful Young Voices.\nIn their [2021 financial statement](https://www.youngminds.org.uk/media/jiuerugu/annual-impact-reports-accounts-2020-21.pdf), they do not state how much they spent on these programmes, which makes it hard to calculate the cost-effectiveness of these programmes. The expenditures are categorized under four categories:\n\n\n- The category with the highest expenditure is Information, Advice and Campaigns, with a cost of £1.246 million, which constitutes 31% of their total project-specific expenditure (p.25). This category entails creating online resources to assist young people and their carers in their struggle with mental health problems, organizing social media campaigns  to increase awareness about young people’s mental health, providing direct online support to struggling young people and their parents, and some other initiatives Their website, which is their main channel for publishing online resources,  received  a total of 9.2 million page views in 20?? (a 51% increase compared to the previous year), 3.7 milion of them being unique users. Their \"Find Help\" pages, where a considerable portion of their information is located , were viewed 2.9 million times, (a 62% increase compared to 2018-2019). Their total following on social media channels increased by 36% to 489,851. \n- Expenditure categorized under Training and Consultancy comprised 28% of the project-specific expenditure with a cost of £1.144 million. This included, but isn’t limited to, training and providing consultation to teachers and school staff  on the issue of well-being and mental health of young people, and delivering training to NHS staff in order to build a more inclusive mental health system.\n- They spent £929k (23% of their project-specific expenditure)  on Youth Engagement (categorized as \"Working with Young People\" in the financial statement) efforts.  This includes, but isn’t limited to, training activists to increase awareness about issues surrounding young people’s mental health, trying to create a more inclusive mental health ecosystem within the UK, and  helping the organization’s outreach efforts. Through their Youth Engagement programme, YoungMinds have 72 activists who, after training,  help YoungMinds run campaigns and aid outreach efforts, although in their impact report there are no concrete numbers on whether activists successfully increased outreach and engagement with YoungMinds programmes.They also trained 12 activists too increase public outreach,in the annual report (p.5) it is stated that these 12 activists were part of high-profile media events which were viewed by 40 million people. In collaboration with the Department of Education  they took part in the Nature Friendly schools programme, which is a programme aimed at informing and training school staff about mental health. They collaborated with 88 schools in total. \n\n- YoungMinds spent £749k  on Parents Services, which corresponds to 18% of their project-specific expenditure. Their main initiative under this category is ‘Parents Helpline’  which provides advice and information to parents who seek to  help their children with their mental health. YoungMinds answered 17,234 phone calls, chat requests and emails as a part of this project in 2020, and had a %96 recommendation rate. Similar to but distinct from Parents Helpline service, YoungMinds also employed a team of experts which delivered 3,825 50-minute phone calls to parents who were seeking professional advice.\n\n\nTheir future strategy is outlined on [page 10](https://www.youngminds.org.uk/media/jiuerugu/annual-impact-reports-accounts-2020-21.pdf) of their financial statement, YoungMinds aims to increase the scale of support (direct and indirect) they provide to young people in the following year by reserving 24% of their surplus for this purpose. They have also reserved 25% of their surplus to increase the digital capacity of the organization.\n\nImpact and expenditure of YoungMinds’ programmes will be explored in detail, but the fact that expenditures of specific projects aren’t stated in their impact report and financial statement makes it hard to do a rigorous cost-effectiveness estimation. Besides scaling their services and increasing outreach, they aim to be more inclusive towards communities that are under-served by the mental health system and in collaboration with four other charities they developing a systemic approach to increase the amount of community health support available in the country.\n\n\nYoungMinds has a lot of initiatives and for the sake of length, only certain, relatively impactful and promising initiatives will be explored. Most of the data presented in the following part is sourced from their  [annual report](https://www.youngminds.org.uk/media/jiuerugu/annual-impact-reports-accounts-2020-21.pdf), between page 2 and 6.\n\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Young Mind compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of YoungMinds’ work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold rating, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert 1 year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar)\n\nFor most projects, outputs are measured through simple surveys or feedback questionnaires in which they ask questions such as \"Would you recommend this service to other people?\" , \"Did you felt more confident after this service?\". Even though feedback questionnaires indicate high satisfaction rates for most projects, the outcomes of the programmes aren’t very clear. Also survey results aren’t public, making it impossible to assess the impact of the programmes. It is quite hard to figure out whether Young Minds programs actually results in a sizable aversion or alleviation of mental health problems and achieve results that would render the charity cost-effective at a level similar to the SoGive Gold Standard. Utilization of tests such as (GAD-7)[https://www.healthnavigator.org.nz/tools/g/general-anxiety-scale-gad-7/) or (PHQ-9)[https://patient.info/doctor/patient-health-questionnaire-phq-9] would warrant a more confident impact evaluation and cost-effectiveness estimation as they are the standard questionnaires used to screen anxiety and depression in the UK.\n\n\nYoungMinds spent most of it’s money for projects that they categorize as  \"Information, Advice and Campaigns\". While this category does not entail only providing online resources, a sizable part of the money was spent on informing people and providing online advice and mental health guides. This implies that the counterfactual impact and marginal impact per dollar donated to YoungMinds might be low, because of the existence of many other charities and institutions operating in the same space and providing online resources on mental health. \n\n*Parents Helpline*\n\nThe cost of this service isn’t disclosed in the financial statement, however there is a restricted fund for this service (money donated on the condition that it will be spent only on this service) with restricted funding spent on the Parents Helpline in 2021 being £353k (p.40). When adjusted to account for non-project costs, this implies that Parents Helpline’s total cost was at least more than £431k, although of course YoungMinds may have spent unrestricted funding on this project also.YoungMinds answered 17,234 phone calls, chat requests and emails as a part of this project.\n\nThis means it cost Young Minds more than £25 to respond to and provide support to a single parent (through chat, mail or phone call).  To meet the SoGive Gold Standard Benchmark, then a single response given to a parent would need to provide benefits equivalent to averting 45 days of depression (or more). We need more information to understand if this programme meets this standard.  96% of the parents assisted through this service said they would recommend it  to other parents too, 81% stated that they learnt something new to assist their child’s/children’s problems, and 82% felt more confident in helping their children (p.4 of the annual report). However this  data is only based on exit surveys, and without the utilization of more rigorous evaluation methods like GAD7 or PHQ-9 tests, it isn’t possible to calculate the cost-effectiveness of this program in an accurate way. More information  is needed to evaluate this programme.\n.  . \n*Other Projects*\n\nYoungMinds’ Crisis Messenger, which is a referral service for the Shout! helpline, has led to 408 active rescues (prevention of suicides). People who were saved found out about the Shout! helpline via YoungMinds but attributing these active rescues solely to YoungMinds would be erroneous since YoungMinds is not directly involved with the provision of this service. We need more infornation to assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of this project.\n\nWithout further data on the cost and impact of specific projects of YoungMinds, it’s hard to accurately estimate cost-effectiveness. Cost of specific projects aren’t stated and their evaluation methods do not seem rigorous, and when most of the data we have about outcomes of the programs are based on simple feedback questionnaires, it’s not possible to make an accurate cost-effectiveness estimation.\n\nFurther information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion of the work of YoungMinds would include:\nA more detailed breakdown of programme and campaign specific costs, for example how much they spent on certain initiatives such as Parents Helpline, Nature Friendly Schools etc. \nUtilization of more rigorous methods such as GAD7 or PHQ9 rather than feedback questionnaires or simple surveys for impact evaluation\nAn assessment of the long-term effects of their programmes, they should track a sample group of beneficiaries and observe whether their coping skills or subjective well-being improved over time.\n\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze ratings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\nBased on the above, we rate YoungMinds as More Information Needed under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective\n- We have no indication of cost-effectiveness, or we do not judge those indications to be promising\n",
