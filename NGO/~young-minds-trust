[The charity](https://youngminds.org.uk/about-us/reports/our-impact-reports/) works to ensure access to mental health care for young people, provides support for parents and carers, and campaigns within schools and the mental health system.",
  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**YoungMinds is rated as More Information Needed on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- YoungMinds is a charity that aims to provide: resources, tools, and direct support to young people who are struggling with their mental health; and also tools and resources for parents and teachers to help and empower young people to look after their mental health\n- Their total expenditure in 2020/21 amounted to £5 million (p.25 of their [annual report](https://www.youngminds.org.uk/media/jiuerugu/annual-impact-reports-accounts-2020-21.pdf)), £4.07 million of which was spent on charitable activities.\n- YoungMinds’ feedback questionnaires indicate high satisfaction and improved well-being for most of their projects, but these impacts are measured only through feedback questionnaires, and the information received via this method is too vague to constitute a rigorous impact evaluation.\n- Overall, we think that more information is needed in order to properly determine if YoungMinds is having an impact per pound donated that reaches the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks.\n\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\n**More about what YoungMinds does -  how they spend your donations**\n\nYoungMinds has three core programmes: Never Alone, Someone to Turn To, and Powerful Young Voices. In their [2020/21 financial statement](https://www.youngminds.org.uk/media/jiuerugu/annual-impact-reports-accounts-2020-21.pdf), they do not state how much they spent on these programmes, which makes it hard to calculate the cost-effectiveness. Instead the expenditures are categorized under four categories:\n- The category with the highest expenditure is Information, Advice and Campaigns which constitutes 31% of their total project-specific expenditure (p.25) with non-project adjusted costs of £1.5m. This category entails creating online resources to assist young people and their carers in their struggle with mental health problems, organizing social media campaigns to increase awareness about young people’s mental health, providing direct online support to struggling young people and their parents, and some other initiatives. Their website, which is their main channel for publishing online resources, received a total of 9.2 million page views in 2020/21 (a 51% increase compared to the previous year), 3.7 million of these being unique users. Their \"Find Help\" pages, where a considerable portion of their information is located, were viewed 2.9 million times, (a 62% increase compared to 2019/20). Their total following on social media channels increased by 36% to 489,851. \n- Expenditure categorized under Training and Consultancy comprised 28% of the project-specific expenditure with non-project adjusted costs of £1.4m. This included, but isn’t limited to, training and providing consultation to teachers and school staff on the issue of well-being and mental health of young people, and delivering training to NHS staff in order to build a more inclusive mental health system.\n- 23% of their project-specific expenditure was on Youth Engagement (categorized as \"Working with Young People\" in the financial statement) efforts with non-project adjusted costs of £1.1m. This includes, but isn’t limited to, training activists to increase awareness about issues surrounding young people’s mental health, trying to create a more inclusive mental health ecosystem within the UK, and helping the organization’s outreach efforts. Through their Youth Engagement programme, YoungMinds have 72 activists who, after training, help YoungMinds run campaigns and aid outreach efforts, although in their impact report there are no concrete numbers on whether activists successfully increased outreach and engagement with YoungMinds programmes. They also trained 12 activists to increase public outreach, who were part of high-profile media events which were viewed by 40 million people (p.5). In collaboration with the Department of Education YoungMinds also took part in the Nature Friendly schools programme, which is a programme aimed at informing and training school staff about mental health, collaborating with 88 schools in total. \n- Parents Services accounted for 18% of their project-specific expenditure with non-project adjusted costs of £900,000. Their main initiative under this category is their ‘Parents Helpline’ which provides advice and information to parents who seek to help their children with their mental health. YoungMinds answered 17,234 phone calls, chat requests and emails as a part of this project in 2020/21, and 96% of the users said they would recommend this service to other parents (p.4 of the annual report). Similar to but distinct from their Parents Helpline service, YoungMinds also employed a team of experts which delivered 3,825 50-minute phone calls to parents who were seeking professional advice.\n\nYoungMinds future strategy (outlined on [page 10](https://www.youngminds.org.uk/media/jiuerugu/annual-impact-reports-accounts-2020-21.pdf)) is to increase the scale of support (direct and indirect) they provide to young people in the following years and also to increase the digital capacity of the organization. \n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does YoungMinds compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of YoungMinds’ work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold rating, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert 1 year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar)\n\nFor most of YoungMinds’ projects, outputs are measured through simple surveys or feedback questionnaires in which they ask questions such as \"Would you recommend this service to other people?\" and \"Did you feel more confident after this service?\". Even though these feedback questionnaires indicate high satisfaction rates for most projects, the outcomes of the programmes aren’t very clear. Also the survey results aren’t public, making it challenging to assess the impact and relative cost-effectiveness of the programmes. The utilization of tests such as [GAD-7](https://www.healthnavigator.org.nz/tools/g/general-anxiety-scale-gad-7/) or [PHQ-9](https://patient.info/doctor/patient-health-questionnaire-phq-9) would enable us to generate a more confident impact evaluation as they are the standard questionnaires used to screen anxiety and depression in the UK. Given the Gold Standard benchmark of £200 to avert a year of severe depression, YoungMinds work would need to provide benefits equivalent to the alleviation of 25,000 years of severe depression (£5m/200).\n\nTheir largest allocation of expenditure was on projects that they categorize as \"Information, Advice and Campaigns\". While this category does not solely entail providing online resources, a sizable part of the money was spent on informing people and providing online advice and mental health guides. Due to the existence of many other charities and institutions operating in the same space and providing online resources on mental health, if YoungMinds didn’t exist young people could likely refer to other online resources for guidance on mental health problems. This suggests that the cost-effectiveness of each extra pound donated to YoungMinds might be low.\n\n*Parents Helpline*\n\nThe cost of this service isn’t disclosed in the financial statement, however there is a restricted fund for this service (money donated on the condition that it will be spent only on this service) with restricted funding spent on the Parents Helpline in 2021 being £353k (p.40). When adjusted to account for non-project costs, this implies that Parents Helpline’s total cost was at least £435k, although of course YoungMinds may have spent unrestricted funding on this project also. YoungMinds answered 17,234 phone calls, chat requests and emails as a part of this project.\n\nThis means it cost YoungMinds more than £25 to respond to and provide support to a single parent (through chat, mail or phone call). To meet the SoGive Gold Standard Benchmark, then a single response given to a parent would need to provide benefits equivalent to averting 45 days of depression (or more). We need more information to understand if this programme meets this standard. 96% of the parents assisted through this service said they would recommend it to other parents, 81% stated that they learnt something new to assist with their child’s/children’s problems, and 82% felt more confident in helping their children (p.4 of the annual report). However this data is only based on exit surveys, and without the utilization of more rigorous evaluation methods like GAD7 or PHQ-9 tests, it isn’t possible to calculate the cost-effectiveness of this program accurately.\n\n*Other Projects*\n\nYoungMinds’ Crisis Messenger, which is a referral service for the Shout! helpline, has led to 408 active rescues (prevention of suicides). People who were saved found out about the Shout! helpline via YoungMinds but attributing these active rescues solely to YoungMinds would be erroneous since YoungMinds is not directly involved with the provision of this service. We need more information on the costs to Shout! providers Mental Health Innovations (MHI) in order to assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of this project.\n\nWithout further data on the cost and impact of specific projects of YoungMinds, it’s hard to accurately estimate cost-effectiveness. The costs of specific projects aren’t stated and given that most of the data we have about outcomes of the programs is based on simple feedback questionnaires, it’s not possible to make an accurate assessment of their cost-effectiveness.\n\nFurther information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion of the work of YoungMinds would include:\n- A more detailed breakdown of programme and campaign specific costs, for example how much they spent on certain initiatives such as their Parents Helpline, Nature Friendly Schools etc. \n- The utilization of more rigorous methods such as GAD7 or PHQ9 rather than feedback questionnaires or simple surveys for impact evaluation.\n- An assessment of the long-term effects of their programmes, they should track a sample group of beneficiaries and observe whether their coping skills or subjective well-being improved over time.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze ratings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate YoungMinds as More Information Needed under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective\n- We have no indication of cost-effectiveness, or we do not judge those indications to be promising)",
