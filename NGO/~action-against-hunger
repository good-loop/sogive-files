They publish their financial reports on their website and list how many people are reached through each of their four main programmes.\nOn the other hand, the SOFA is unfortunately not very detailed. There is just the overall costs of all projects together stated, not divided into the four main programmes, which makes it impossible to calculate a decisive cost-efficiency-analysis.",
