  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**Malaria Consortium is rated as More Information Needed (promising) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- Malaria Consortium seeks to combat communicable diseases, such as malaria, and improve health related outcomes in Africa and Asia.\n- Malaria Consortium’s largest and best documented activity is their assistance distributing seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), a highly effective treatment for preventing death and serious illness among young children.\n- Research appears to show that the average cost of each death averted through Malaria Consortium’s SMC program is between £435 and £3670, varying between regions and analyses.\n-More information is needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Malaria Consortium’s other programs.\n-While Malaria Consortium’s other programs were not evaluated, the cost effectiveness of their SMC program outperforms the Gold Standard benchmark of saving a life for £5,000.\n-Therefore, Malaria Consortium is rated as More Information Needed (promising).\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what Malaria Consortium does - how they spend your donations**\n\nMalaria Consortium works to improve health related outcomes in Africa and Asia by improving health care coverage and combatting targeted diseases such as malaria, pneumonia, dengue and other communicable diseases. In addition to preventative treatment and vector control, Malaria Consortium promotes its objectives through research and monitoring, policy advocacy, and spending to improve community health systems. \n\nOne of the most prominent activities performed by the charity, accounting for 44% of Malaria Consortium’s spending, is the distribution of seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) for children between the ages of 3 and 59 months. According to Malaria Consortium’s latest report, they reached 12 million children over a one year period while spending about £29,439,000 on SMC (when other costs are allocated in proportion to charitable spending). SMC consists of the provision of full courses of antimalarial medicines during the four month malaria season, which has been found to reduce the amount of cases that result in severe illness and death. Malaria Consortium promotes SMC distribution by providing technical, logistical and financial support for SMC campaigns, while distribution is performed locally through trained local health care workers. The charity also helps administer the provision of preventative treatment other than SMC, such as intermittent preventive treatment. £2,779,000 or about 4% of the charity’s spending is spent on this category. Intermittent preventive treatment provides vulnerable subjects with antimalarial drugs, regardless of whether they are diagnosed with malaria, in hopes of protecting them against illness.\n\nIn addition, Malaria Consortium spends about £5,979,000, or about 9% of its spending, on vector control programs. While Malaria Consortium has developed programs for a variety of operations within this category, such as one that targets dengue in Cambodia, one of the charity’s most notable programs within this category is the distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). LLINs are nets that have been treated with insecticide that kill or repel mosquitos who come into contact with them and last for three years without being retreated. LLINs have been found to be highly effective at preventing malaria infection and decreasing the risk of mortality caused by malaria. Outcomes and spending on this program and others in this category, as implemented by Malaria Consortium, is not as clear as with SMC. While the annual report for Malaria Consortium separates SMC costs from all others and lists the costs of many of its programs, it does not list the cost and outcomes of these activities in categories of specific interventions similar to SMC for this reporting period. Research on the effectiveness of a LLIN campaign administered by Malaria Consortium in Nigeria, which may aid in this area, is currently being conducted.\n\nMalaria Consortium also spent £15,137,000, or about 23% of their spending in the reporting year ending in 2021, on strengthening health care systems. This involves technical assistance, supporting supply chain efficiency and training health workers. Another charitable activity that Malaria Consortium performs is case management, which accounts for £13,365,000 or 20% of the charity’s spending. Case management consists of building capacity for community health workers to effectively respond to children suffering from diseases and health issues such as pneumonia, malaria and malnutrition. Work supporting these goals include training community health workers on case management processes, building skills of facilities and communities at providing correct treatment following diagnosis, and strengthening referral systems. Malaria Consortium further performs policy research and advocacy and spends about £123,000 or less than 1% of its spending, towards this end. \n\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Malaria Consortium compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of Malaria Consortium’s work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold rating, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nMalaria Consortium’s largest and best documented program is their SMC program. SMC has strong evidence in favour of its effectiveness medically and has been recommended by the World Health Organization since 2012. [One analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8457484/) of studies across five countries and 7 programs found a personal protection rate between 73% and 98% at protecting against clinical malaria for 28 days following a treatment.\n\nA straightforward analysis of Malaria Consortium’s SMC program, where the amount spent on the program (£29,439,000) is divided by the number of children reached (12,568,449), leads to the calculation that it takes around £2.34 to offer at least one round of SMC to one child. This means that the equivalent of one life would have to be saved by the distribution of SMC to about 2,100 children for it to outperform SoGive’s Gold Standard of £5,000 per life saved. At least two in-depth analyses on the cost effectiveness of Malaria Consortium’s SMC program, in terms of lives saved, have been performed. Both of these reach the conclusion that the program outperforms the £5,000 per life saved benchmark. [Givewell](https://www.givewell.org/impact-estimates) concludes that it costs £3,670 (converted from USD, June 2022) for Malaria Consortium to save one life. A 2021 [study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30475-7/fulltext) conducted over seven countries in the Sahel region of Africa furthermore estimated the average cost of saving a life ranged from £435 to £1,840 (converted from USD) across those seven countries. For the above reasons, it seems reasonable to expect that the distribution of SMC by Malaria Consortium outperforms the Gold Standard.\n\nHowever, evaluating Malaria Consortium in its entirety is not currently possible with the data that’s been provided. While the charity provides a significant amount of data and research regarding their programs, the information for programs other than SMC are not presented in a way that makes forming generalizations about their outcomes and costs difficult. While some of their other programs seem promising, such as LLIN distribution, more information is required to determine the overall effectiveness of the charity. This information, which would further breakdown each of the categories of the charity’s report, alongside what outcomes this spending accomplished, is necessary to determine the effectiveness of the charity’s other programs. For these reasons, more information is needed.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze ratings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Malaria Consortium as More Information Needed (promising) under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do have some indication of cost-effectiveness, and it naively seems like it may be competitive with the Gold Standard\n",
