  "description": "Every year, [one in four people](https://www.mind.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/) suffers from a mental health condition. Mind provides mental health information and support, organizes a local network of specialized service providers, conduct professional training to promote mental health in the workplace, and run campaigns on mental-health-related issues. ",
  "recommendation": "**Mind achieves a Bronze assessment under the SoGive rating methodology.**\nTentative:\n\nThis charity supplies mental health support and information organises a community network of specialized service providers helps improve mental health standards in the workplace and champions the rights of those affected by mental health problems.\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-sogive-approach-to-assessing.html), we consider two questions:\n- how much does it cost for the charity to do something\n- what is the thing (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)\n\n**More about what Mind does**\n\nThe most comprehensive information we obtained about Mind\u0027s activities comes from 2015, so the following analysis does not completely represent Mind\u0027s effectiveness today. Based on the information we gathered from the 2014/15 accounts, we estimated the costs of major mental health services for one beneficiary. Three types of services directly treated mental conditions. Talking treatment accounted for 16% of service provision and cost around £450 per person. Services to special groups accounted for 12% of service provision and cost about £1,700 per person. Residential care took up 7% of service provision and cost about £2,400 per person per year. Another three types of services offered social support to people who experience mental issues. Advice and advocacy accounted for 15% of service provision and cost about £130 per person. Services that had to do with employment and skills accounted for 11% of the service and cost about £680 per person. Community support services such as befriending amounted to 37% of the service provided and cost around £860 per person. \n\nIn addition to these six services, Mind also provided crisis services and campaigned to secure better conditions for people struggling with mental health issues. The impact of campaigns prove inherently difficult to estimate, according to [one of our earlier analyses](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/is-it-better-to-fund-direct-work-or.html?view\u003dsidebar), but according to the report, these two projects accounted respectively for only 1% of the charity\u0027s service provision, so we have left the two initiatives out of our analysis.\n\n**Benchmarking**\n\nAfter a review of Mind\u0027s work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing Mind to benchmark charities. These benchmark charities have strong cost-effectiveness and evidence for their effectiveness. For these benchmark charities, you should be able to achieve an outcome about as good as saving a life for around £1,500. Example benchmark charities include the [Against Malaria Foundation](https://app.sogive.org/#charity?charityId\u003dagainst-malaria-foundation)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAmong the three major mental health services examined above that directly treat mental issues, talking treatment had the lowest per beneficiary cost. If talking treatment for 1 person costs £450, then £1,500 could fund just over 3 people supported.\n\nWe see 3 people receiving mental health care during a year as less positive of an outcome than saving someone\u0027s life. Mind\u0027s therapy appears unlikely to have the same order of magnitude of impact as saving one\u0027s life, for [the organization noted](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/talking-therapy-and-counselling/about-talking-therapies/#WhatCanTherapyHelpWith) that people not at a crisis point can also seek support from therapy.\n\nAmong the three major mental health services examined above that do not directly treat mental issues, those related to advice and advocacy has the lowest per beneficiary cost. If advice and advocacy for 1 person cost £130, then £1,500 could fund nearly 12 people supported. \n\nAssuming that this supplementary support does not have the same order of magnitude of impact as direct treatment, we see 12 mentally troubled people becoming more socially supported as less positive of an outcome than saving someone\u0027s life. \n\nFor reference, when we describe a charity as Bronze-rated, we mean that\n- we expect, but cannot prove, that the charity\u0027s work likely has a positive impact\n- we have good reason to believe that the charity underperforms a Gold-rated charity (i.e. achieves less positive impact per pound donated than a Gold-rated charity)",
