  "description": "Mind, also called the National Association for Mental Health, works on mental health issues in the UK.

  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**Mind is rated as More Information Needed on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- Mind runs a wide variety of programs related to mental health, including preventative trainings, information and support helplines, national awareness campaigns, and more.\n- Mind’s annual reports do not contain breakdowns of the organization’s spending across its many varied programs.\n- Therefore, we do not have enough information to compare Mind to our Gold Standard charities at this time.\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what Mind does - how they spend your donations**\n\nMind runs a wide variety of programs related to mental health. They offer preventative mental health trainings, support local Mind groups, staff helplines, join in legal challenges relevant to people with mental illness, run national awareness campaigns, and more. During the 2019-20 financial year, Mind spent about £45 million across all their charitable and fundraising activities.\n\nBased on the [2019-20 annual report](https://www.mind.org.uk/media/6823/mind-2019_20-annual-review-and-financial-statements.pdf) and other recent annual reports ([2018-19](https://www.mind.org.uk/media/4461/mind-annual-review-and-financial-statements-2018-19.pdf), [2017-18](https://www.mind.org.uk/media-a/4481/mind-annual-review-and-financial-statements-2017-18.pdf)), it is not clear how Mind’s spending breaks down across projects or across types of projects. Mind’s reports divide their spending into thematic categories, but each thematic category could encompass many projects and many types of projects. For example, the largest thematic category of spending is \"Helping people take part in society equally,\" which accounted for close to 50% of Mind’s spending during the 2019-20 year. Mind describes this category as \"Our work on home and community, welfare, work and rights, leadership and participation, and stigma and discrimination\" (2019-20 annual report, p.39). Within this category, the 2019-20 report highlights Mind’s participation in a legal challenge to the sick pay system, while the 2018-19 report highlights Mind’s awareness-raising partnership with the English Football League, a very different project. We do not know how much spending within \"Helping people take part in society equally\" each of these projects accounted for, nor do we have a comprehensive list of other projects that are included in this category. In order to understand how Mind typically spends donations, we need more information about how their spending breaks down across their many projects and goals. \n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Mind compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of Mind’s work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold rating, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as averting a year of severe depression for £200, or saving a life for £5,000) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nAs discussed above, Mind’s annual reports do not contain breakdowns of the organization’s spending across projects or types of projects. The annual reports do contain some examples of the organization’s achievements: for example, during the 2019-20 year, Mind responded to over 119,000 helpline queries. However, we do not know how much of Mind’s annual spending went towards helpline costs, so we cannot calculate how cost-effectively they are responding to helpline queries. Furthermore, we do not have good evidence about how beneficial Mind’s helplines are to a typical user. \n\nIn order to assign Mind a specific rating, we would want to see a breakdown of costs across Mind’s varied projects and programs, and evidence of the benefits of at least some of those projects and programs. Currently, we rate Mind as More Information Needed. \n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze ratings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Mind as More Information Needed under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective.\n- We have no indication of cost-effectiveness, or we do not judge those indications to be promising.",
