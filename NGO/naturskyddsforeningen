  "description": "The Swedish Society for Nature Conservation was formed in May 1909 and has since been involved in influencing most major decisions on environmental issues, such as environmental legislation, the establishment of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and the existence of eco-labeling of goods and services.\n\nBy supporting and collaborating with the global environmental movement, the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation contributes to stronger participation and impact on issues of sustainable development in local and global development processes. Climate, forestry, agriculture, environmental toxins, water, sea and sustainable consumption are our most important areas of work.",
