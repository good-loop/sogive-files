  "recommendation": "**ActionAid UK is rated as More Information Needed on the SoGive ratings scale**\n\nActionAid is an international non-governmental organization whose primary aim is to work against poverty and injustice worldwide, with an emphasis on women’s rights. ActionAid UK is part of the wider ActionAid International Federation and is a UK-registered charity.\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\n**More about what ActionAid UK does - how they spend your donations**\n\nActionAid UK’s work is divided into four projects. The first is emergency and humanitarian response, which entails work such as supporting people after natural disasters, and distributing supplies such as bednets (to prevent infection with malaria), food, and sanitary products. According to their [annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA10406859\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d274467), they spent £4,800,000 on this project in 2019.\n\nThe second project is campaigning and policy work, which includes gathering signatures for petitions and open letters to the British government in support of women’s rights. According to their annual report, they spent £2,231,000 on this project in 2019.\nThe third project is education, which includes educating the public about the problems they help address and running public health education campaigns. According to their annual report, they spent £2,965,000 on this project in 2019.\n\nThe last and largest project involved providing grants to ActionAid International and Federation members to be spent on their emergency relief, humanitarian relief, long-term development and rehabilitation projects worldwide. According to their annual report, they spent £29,282,000 on this project in 2019. They explain that \"ActionAid International brings together the work of the ActionAid International Federation\", while \"The Federation is made up of 43 national organisations, most of which are based in developing countries\" (Annual Report 2019, p. 15). \n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis  - how does ActionAid UK compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of ActionAid UK under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as saving someone’s life for £5000) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. \n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nActionAid UK lists some of the outcomes of their projects in their annual report. For example, they state that they \"distributed food packages to over 10,000 people affected by flooding in Bangladesh\" (p. 8), that they \"reached more than 250,280 Rohingya refugees\" (p. 28), and that their efforts led to \"300 more girls attending school in Idjwi\" (p. 14). \n\nThere are two issues preventing us from using this information to assess its cost-effectiveness. The first is that for most projects, it is not clear whether the outcomes listed are exhaustive or not. The second and more significant issue is that many of the outcomes are very vague. In the case of their emergency and humanitarian response project, the 880,000 people supported in emergencies (p. 25) may be exhaustive. This would mean it costs around an average of £5 or £6 to support each person. However, it is not clear what it means for them to have \"supported\" a person. Many of their outcomes use ambiguous terms such as \"supported\" or \"reached\", and without further clarity, we cannot know the impact that ActionAid UK has had on these individuals.\n\nIn order to conduct an assessment of ActionAid UK, we would need more information on how many people ActionAid UK’s programs reached, robust evidence of the extent to which people benefited from being reached by those programs, and how much money ActionAid UK spent on this effort. Furthermore, since around ¾ of ActionAid UK’s charitable expenditure is directed towards ActionAid International, we would need similar information about ActionAid International’s work as well. We might also want additional information about the extent to which they collaborate with other NGOs (or other organisations), which could mean any costs per person reached are an underestimate of the true costs (i.e. if other organisations are contributing some of the costs of reaching the same people).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate ActionAid UK as More Information Needed under the SoGive methodology. \n",
