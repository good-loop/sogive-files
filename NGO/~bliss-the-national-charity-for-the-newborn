  "description": "The charity offers support for families, brings aid to medical professionals, campaigns for policy change, and funds related scientific research. The charity was set up [40 years](https://www.bliss.org.uk/about-us/about-bliss/our-timeline) ago by concerned parents.",
  "recommendation": "**To evaluate Bliss under the SoGive rating methodology, we would need more information.**\n\nThis charity hopes to enhance the chance of survival and quality of life for babies in neonatal wards. According to the charity\u0027s [2018/19 financial report](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/files.bliss.org.uk/documents/A201-Bliss-Annual-Report-and-financial-statements-2018-19-FINAL.pdf?mtime\u003d20200220150704), Bliss\u0027s work during the 2018/19 financial year consisted of 4 projects: guidance for families, support for medical professionals, campaigns for neonatal rights, and scientific research about newborn care.\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-sogive-approach-to-assessing.html), we consider two questions:\n- how much does it cost for the charity to do something\n- what is the thing (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)\n\n**More about what Bliss does**\n\nBliss spent £2.7 million in the 2018/19 financial year.\n\nThe charity spent roughly 43% of charitable expenditures on offering guidance to families. Bliss has circulated guidebooks about neonatal care in online and paper forms. For more personalized help, Bliss organized volunteers to provide cot-side emotional support and maintained a helpline service over telephone and email. We do not have comprehensive numeric data on the number of parents reached through such diverse services, nor do we have full knowledge of parents\u0027 responses to the guidance. We do know that [95%](https://www.bliss.org.uk/about-us/our-impact) of parents helped would recommend Bliss\u0027s information.\n\nBliss directed 38% of charitable expenditures towards medical professionals. Examples of the charity\u0027s work in this area include training sessions, which covered topics like how medical professions can help with parents\u0027 mental health. Bliss also promoted the Bliss Baby Charter, which calls on the standardization of neonatal hospital care. We do not know the cost of each of these initiatives. We do not know whether Bliss\u0027s support has enhanced medical professionals\u0027 ability to prevent deaths of newborns, and we do not know if other organizations like the NHS would have taken up these initiatives had Bliss not pursued these activities.\n\nThe charity used 16% of charitable expenditures on campaigns for neonatal rights. Many achievements in this area involved bereavement. Partly thanks to Bliss\u0027s campaigns, Parliament passed the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act, and the Welsh government established a Bereavement Support Working Group. Especially considering that Bliss has collaborated with other organization like Sands, we do not know the exact extent to which Bliss influenced the decisionmakers. Also, we do not know the cost of each of these initiatives. What would the money have been used for, if Bliss had not succeeded in its campaigns? As [our earlier analysis](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/is-it-better-to-fund-direct-work-or.html?view\u003dsidebar) shows, the impact of public campaigns proves particularly hard to estimate.\n\nFinally, Bliss spent 3% of charitable expenses on funding and organizing scientific research about neonatal care. This percentage appears small enough for us to leave this project out of our analysis. Our earlier [analysis](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/is-it-better-to-fund-direct-work-or.html?view\u003dsidebar) has tentatively suggested that peer-reviewed research may have some positive impacts.\n\n**Benchmarking**\n\nAfter a review of the work of Bliss under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process would involve comparing Bliss to benchmark charities. These benchmark charities have strong cost-effectiveness and evidence for their effectiveness. These benchmark charities should achieve an outcome about as good as saving a life for around £1,500. Example benchmark charities include the [Against Malaria Foundation](https://app.sogive.org/#charity?charityId\u003dagainst-malaria-foundation).\n\nData from 2015 suggested that in one of Bliss projects, supporting one family over the phone or with the help of volunteers cost about £400. However, the 2018/19 annual report does not make clear the current costs for Bliss to perform helpline services.\n\nOther telephone-helpline charities typically have a lower cost per call answered. For example, the fee per call for Samaritans is around £4. To believe that funding the work of Bliss outperforms funding Samaritans, one would have to see a call with Bliss as a hundred times more valuable than a call with Samaritans or believe that Bliss has better room for more funding. One may hold such an opinion if the evidence for the effectiveness of Bliss proves substantially stronger than for that of Samaritans. We are unaware of any evidence that comprehensively determines the effectiveness of Bliss\u0027s work.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe would need more information to determine the effectiveness of a marginal pound donated to Bliss and whether it meets the SoGive Gold standard, i.e. whether a £1,500 donation would lead to an impact as positive or more positive than saving a life.\n\nFurther information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion of the work of Bliss would include\na) a more comprehensive cost assessment. How much did Bliss spend on the specific initiatives that fall under larger categories as defined by the charity\u0027s 4 projects? \n\nb) a more comprehensive impact assessment. How many families have received support from Bliss, and what difference did it make in their lives? How many medical professionals did Bliss support, and how many patients did they go on to serve? How many babies\u0027 lives were saved as a result of this, or, if saving lives was not the goal, what was? How crucial were the treatments of these professionals? What were the impacts of Bliss\u0027s campaigns during the financial year? Ultimately, what would happen if the charity did not provide its services? ",
