  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**To assign a firm rating to Samaritans under the SoGive rating methodology, we would need more information, but the charity is promising**\n\n- Samaritans’ vision is that fewer people die by suicide, which they accomplish primarily via confidential emotional support from their 24-hour phone listening service, email correspondence, face to face, letters and mobile app\n- There is no publicly available evidence of the charity accomplishing their stated vision of preventing suicide. However, under generous assumptions, the charity’s primary service as a helpline achieves an outcome as good as averting one year of severe depression for approximately £186, which is a promising sign\n- However, we need confidence in Samaritans’ results through a more rigorously designed impact assessment and therefore cannot form a confident opinion about their effectiveness\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what Samaritans does - how they spend your donations**\n\nSamaritans’ [2021 Annual Report](https://media.samaritans.org/documents/Samaritans_Annual_Report_and_Accounts_2020-21.pdf) outlines the details of the £22 million that they spent during their fiscal year.\n\n34% and 26% of Samaritans’ charitable expenditure went to Service and Access respectively, which involve running their helpline service, ensuring quality through activities such as supporting volunteers, and expanding services to online chat and their self-help mobile app. In total, these services reach approximately 3 million callers, 540,000 emails, 1,200 letters, 11,500 (19,714 annualised) online chats, 65,000 people locally and 50,000 (54,545 annualised) users on the mobile app.\n\n17% of expenditure went toward partnerships to raise awareness and encourage help-seeking. For example, they advised 400 media professionals reporting on suicide, started conversations about the impact of COVID on suicide rates, trained railway staff who made life-saving interventions, and reached millions through social media campaigns.\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Samaritans compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of Samaritans under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nBased on the Samaritans’ [2021 Impact Report](https://media.samaritans.org/documents/SamaritansImpactReport2020_21_WEB_ACC-min.pdf), we know that it costs Samaritans £5 to answer a call for help, factoring in the cost of recruiting volunteers, training and development, keeping the helplines running and other operational costs. We also know the following about the topics and outcomes of the calls:\n- 1 in 4 calls for help were about suicidal thoughts or feelings\n- 1 in 12 calls for help were about self-harm\n- Callers report a significant reduction in distress between the beginning and end of a call: an average change from 7.4 to 4.2 on a scale from 0 to 10\n- A week later, 7 out of 10 callers said they were still feeling better than before\n\nIn order for Samaritans to meet the SoGive Gold Standard, we would have to believe that the benefit that callers receive is sufficiently large to warrant the cost compared to the impact of directing the funds to a charity that meets the standard. Quantitatively, this means we would have to expect at least one life saved (that otherwise would not be) per 1000 calls or at least one year of severe depression averted per 40 calls.\n\nIdeally, we would also have concrete evidence that their services are directly accomplishing their stated vision of fewer people dying by suicide. As is, we are unable to confidently conclude that their services have lasting life-saving impact from the outcomes stated in their impact report.\n\nIn lieu of direct evidence of the charity’s stated vision (saving lives of those considering suicide), if Samaritans’ theory of change is to prevent suicides by reducing negative feelings and self-harm, we can alternatively compare their cost-effectiveness to our Gold Standard charities by comparing with years of severe depression averted. The results from their impact report and the relatively low cost of £5 per call are both initially promising signs in terms of cost-effectiveness, but in order for us to form a firm view of the impact of Samaritans’ work we would need more confidence in their results through a more rigorous assessment of impact. This would come in the form of control groups, study design that accounts for regression to the mean baseline level of distress for individuals over time, evidence of controlling for selection effects that would influence caller responses, and confirmation of effects persisting past a week.\n\nIn the best case scenario, the charity’s theory of change is as stated above, their study of impact is properly controlled, and the following generous assumptions hold:\n- A decline from 7.4 to 4.2 constitutes averting severe depression\n- Callers who still felt better after one week would experience the same effect for an average of two weeks\n\nIn that case, they would be able to achieve an outcome as good as averting one year of severe depression for £5 * (52 weeks / 2 weeks) / (seven out of ten callers) \u003d ~£186, and Samaritans would compare favorably with SoGive’s Gold standard charities.\n\nOutside of calls into the helpline, we cannot provide a cost-effectiveness assessment for a donated pound allocated to Samaritans’ other services. There is no publicly available detailed information about costs involved in delivering their new services, nor information about their effectiveness.\n\nA full cost-effectiveness model would also take into account counterfactuals. Based on an archive of their [information resource pack](https://web.archive.org/web/20130311131453/http://www.samaritans.org/sites/default/files/kcfinder/files/2012%20information%20resource%20pack.pdf), we know that Samaritans utilizes volunteers much more than the average charity, which raises the question about the opportunity cost of their volunteers’ time.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Samaritans as More Information Needed (promising) under the SoGive methodology. Under generous assumptions about the validity of their study of impact, the charity’s primary service as a helpline achieves an outcome as good as averting one year of severe depression for approximately £186, which would meet the SoGive Gold Standard.\n\nFurther information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion of the work of Samaritans would be a more rigorous impact assessment of Samaritans’ distress alleviation\n\nFull disclosure: a SoGive Director is a Samaritans volunteer.\n",
