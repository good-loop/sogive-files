  "description": "NDCS vision is \"a world without barriers for every deaf child\", and their ambition is that \"by 2030 no deaf child will be left behind\". To achieve this, NDCS has a continued focus on three key areas:\n- **Overcoming barriers in local and national services**.\n- **Overcoming barriers in language and communication**.\n- **Overcoming barriers to independence**.\n-",
  "recommendation": "We do not have enough information to be able to form a strong view on this charity\u0027s effectiveness. However, based on our initial review of the (inadequate) information that we have, it seems that a number of assumptions would have to be fulfilled in order for this to be a high-impact charity. \n\nIn particular, the extra information we would need includes:\n- a more detailed breakdown of the costs by activity so that we know how much it cost for the charity to achieve what they have achieved\n- more information on counterfactuals (e.g. if government spend on deaf children hadn\u0027t been increased, what else would it have been spent on?)\n- more information on impact (e.g. to what extent does it make people\u0027s lives better if a deaf child volunteers more or uses a sport facility more?)\n\n-----------------------------\n\n**More on National Deaf Children\u0027s Society and their work**\n\nThe 2017-18 annual report and accounts sets out three areas of focus:\n- Overcoming barriers in local and national services\n- Overcoming barriers in language and communication\n- Overcoming barriers to independence\n\nThe split of funds between these is roughly one half to \"Overcoming barriers in local and national services\" and a quarter each to the other two areas.\n\nWithin each of the areas, the charity sets out an objective and a self-assessment on their achievements in this area.\n\nThe first is:\n\"We will challenge local and national cuts and advocate for improvements in the quality of services.\"\nWhich the charity believes it has achieved.\n\nWhen the charity gets local or national government to allocate more resource to deaf children, this comes at a cost -- those resources cannot be allocated to other things. As we don\u0027t know what the other things are, it\u0027s hard to know the full impact of this, all things considered. In the absence of any other information, it seems reasonable to believe that the counterfactual use of the funds would have delivered similar value, and so to a first order approximation the value achieved is zero. A significantly more in-depth analysis would be needed to form a more sophisticated view on impact of this work.\n\nAnother risk (which we have not carefully considered) that changes in government decisions are not entirely attributable to National Deaf Children\u0027s Society.\n\nOne of the charity\u0027s goals is: \n\"We will increase the opportunities for deaf children and young people to take part in society by providing resources, support and training for activity leaders\"\n\nThis work has involved creating deaf-friendly standards. The charity did not consider this work to have been fully completed as per their target, however if the target had been achieved they would have finalised the standards and have 300 sports and leisure organisations reach the accreditation.\n\nAssuming this had been achieved, much would still have been unclear to us. it would have been unclear whether deaf children actually use the facilities more, let alone how much better their lives are because of using those facilities. It also is unclear to what extent accredited organisations improve in order to achieve the accreditation, or whether the accreditation simply indicates a standard which had already been met. Hence it would also have been unclear whether deaf children who are in any case using the facilities would have had a better experience as a result of the accreditation.\n\nIn order for the accreditation work to be considered high-impact, we would need to see \n- evidence that the work had been delivered at a low cost (i.e. high level of efficiency), and \n- if the impact is achieved through getting more deaf children to use the facilities, we would need to see that the amount of extra effort needed (possibly effort performed outside of this charity) to get deaf children to participate was low, and \n- that the difference it makes to each child\u0027s life is sufficiently high.\n\nWe don\u0027t have enough evidence to form a strong view on this.\n\nAs this is a brief review, we have not continued to review each activity in detail.\n\n",
