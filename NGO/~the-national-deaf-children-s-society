  "description": "NDCS vision is \"a world without barriers for every deaf child\", and their ambition is that \"by 2030 no deaf child will be left behind\". To achieve this, NDCS has a continued focus on three key areas:\n- **Overcoming barriers in local and national services**.\n- **Overcoming barriers in language and communication**.\n- **Overcoming barriers to independence**.\n-",
  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**The National Deaf Children\u0027s Society is rated as Not Recommended (Firm) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- The National Deaf Children\u0027s Society’s (NDCS) objective is to further the education and support the needs of deaf children.\n- Assuming the annual impact of NDCS is equivalent to mitigating all of the UK’s hearing loss-related disease burden for one whole year, for people younger than 30, it would avert the loss of about 24k years of healthy life per year.\n- Considering that averting the loss of 50 years of healthy life is approximately equivalent to saving one life, the charity’s annual impact would be equivalent to saving roughly 480 lives. \n- Given the charity’s total annual expenditure of £28.1M, the above outcome would imply an average cost of £60k per life saved, which is 12 times as high as the SoGive Gold Standard of £5k per life saved. In other words, for the NDCS’ cost-effectiveness to match the SoGive Gold Standard, it would have to achieve an annual improvement in well-being equivalent to averting all of the UK’s hearing loss-related disease burden, for people younger than 30, for roughly one decade.\n- While there may be positive impacts on well-being from the charity’s annual help given to deaf children and young adults, we do not believe the charity achieves an outcome as good as this. Furthermore, without the intervention of NDCS, some of the deaf children might have been helped by other actors (such as the NHS and social services).\n- For these reasons, it is very likely that a donation to NDCS will achieve less positive impact than the same amount of money given to a Gold-rated organisation, so we do not currently recommended donating to NCDS\n\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n\n**More about what NDCS does - how they spend your donations**\n\nNDCS’ vision is \"a world without barriers for every deaf child\", and their ambition is that \"by 2030 no deaf child will be left behind\" ([2019/2020 annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA10755003\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d1016532), pp. 2 and 3). Its total expenditure of £28.1M for the year ending 31 March 2020 was allocated was allocated as follows ([2019/2020 annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA10755003\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d1016532), p. 30):\n- Charitable activities (57%):\n\t- Overcoming barriers in local and national services (29%). \"We will defend services for deaf children and young people against reductions in local authority budgets, identify policy solutions and advocate for investment and improvement in the quality of services\" (p. 3).\n\t- Overcoming barriers in language and communication (11%). \"We will help families to support the language and communication skills of their deaf child, particularly in the early years\" (p. 6).\n\t- Overcoming barriers to independence (10%). \"We will support deaf children and young people by continuing to develop our youth membership offer, providing opportunities to help them connect to support and information and to our face-to-face activities and engagement opportunities\" (p. 8).\n- Other charitable activities (6.4%).\n- Raising funds (43%).\n\nNDCS summarises its impact as follows ([2019/2020 Impact Report](https://www.ndcs.org.uk/media/6514/national_deaf_childrens_society_impact_report_2019_2020.pdf), pp. 6 and 7):\n- \"240 deaf children took part in our confidence building events\".\n- \"98% of professionals rated our conference on mental health as good or excellent\".\n- \"93% success rate in appealing against decisions on deaf children’s education\".\n- \"23,400 views of our award-winning film for deaf young people\".\n- \"11,700 people learned more about deafness on our Roadshow bus\".\n- \"200 deaf young people shared views on our new youth website\".\n- \"10,000 people fought for change through our Campaigns Network\".\n- \"2,600 deaf children and young people supported in developing countries\".\nFurther details regarding the impact of the charity are provided throughout the impact report.\n\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does NDCS compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of NDCS under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 to save one life, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nFurther information about the impact of NDCS’ charitable activities on the beneficiaries,  beyond those provided in the charity’s impact report, would be needed in order to estimate its overall cost-effectiveness more accurately. Nevertheless, an upper bound can be hypothesised whereby it is assumed that the annual impact of NDCS is equivalent to mitigating all of the UK’s disease burden related to hearing loss for one whole year), for people younger than 30 (as the charity focuses on children and young adults).\n\n\"Burden of disease\" refers to the combined effect of mortality (null for hearing loss) and morbidity, and can be measured in \"Disability Adjusted Life Years\" (DALYs). \"Conceptually, one DALY is the equivalent of losing one year in good health because of either premature death or disease or disability. One DALY represents one lost year of healthy life\" ([OWID](https://ourworldindata.org/burden-of-disease)). We note that NCDS is focused on social and development issues, rather than treating or preventing deafness. Thus, using DALYs risks over-or-understating NCDS’ impact to the extent that the disability weight of the DALY accurately reflects how NCDS’ charitable activities improve the overall well-being of their beneficiaries. However, the disability weight of the DALY does often incorporate the ability to ‘participate in usual activities’ (see [here](https://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/en/9241546204chap3.pdf) for details), which seems central to what NCDS are focusing on with their charitable activities.\n\nAccording to [GBD 2019](https://www.healthdata.org/gbd/2019), the burden of disease in the UK for \"age-related and other hearing loss\", for people younger than 30, [was 24k DALYs](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool?params\u003dgbd-api-2019-permalink/d528e13dc097d436e2232b58929861b1). Consequently, averting 24k DALYs is the hypothesised upper bound for NDCS’ annual impact. \n\nConsidering that saving one life is approximately [equivalent to averting 50 DALYs](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/technical-updates-our-global-health-and-wellbeing-cause-prioritization-framework#Measurement_of_DALYs), averting 24k DALYs is equivalent to saving roughly 500 lives (23.88k / 50 \u003d 480). This, and the charity’s total annual expenditure of £28.1M, imply an upper bound for NDCS’ cost-effectiveness of £60k per life saved, which is about 12 times as large as the SoGive Gold Standard of £5k per life saved. (Following the GBD approach would result in using a conversion factor of [more than 80 DALYs per life saved](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/technical-updates-our-global-health-and-wellbeing-cause-prioritization-framework#How_we_previously_compared_health_and_income), which would imply a higher cost per life saved.)\n\nIn other words, for the NDCS cost-effectiveness to match the SoGive Gold Standard of £5k to save one life, it would have to achieve an annual improvement in well-being equivalent to averting all of the UK’s hearing loss-related disease burden, for people younger than 30, for roughly one decade. While there may be positive impacts on well-being from the charity’s annual help given to deaf children and young adults, we do not believe the charity achieves an outcome as good as this. Furthermore, without the intervention of NDCS, some of the deaf children and young adults might have been helped by other actors (such as the NHS and social services). Consequently, it is highly likely that a donation to NDCS will achieve less positive impact than the same amount of money given to a Gold-rated organisation.\n\nNevertheless, further information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion would be:\n- Metrics describing the overall impact of the charity, such as the total number of deaf children helped, and data on how their well-being changes due to the charity’s work.\n- The data on well-being should come from impact evaluations of the direct work, based on adequately powered and robustly-designed studies, preferably randomised controlled trials. Alternatively, the charity could demonstrate that it is implementing its interventions in a way that is consistent with previous high-quality research. These should ideally also assess the long-term impact of the interventions.\n- Clear breakdown of the costs for each of the three key areas, so the costs of interventions within each area are specified.\n- Theory of change for the campaigning work, including an assessment of the extent of its impact, and a description of the contribution of other actors external to NDCS (such as the NHS and social services). This involves some challenges, as we have pointed out in an earlier [analysis](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/is-it-better-to-fund-direct-work-or.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate The National Deaf Children\u0027s Society as Not Recommended (Firm) under the SoGive methodology.
