  "description": "The charity has a recommendation from GiveWell based on careful data-driven analysis",
  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**Helen Keller International is rated as Gold (firm) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- Helen Keller International (HKI) provides technical assistance, engages in advocacy, and contributes funding to government-run vitamin A supplementation programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. HKI aims to reduce malnutrition, avert blindness and poor vision, and reduce child mortality. \n- Based on our in-depth analysis of HKI, which builds on the work of highly respected charity analysis organisation [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/charities/helen-keller-international), we believe that HKI’s vitamin A supplementation programmes costs around £2,200 per life saved. \n- This is more cost-effective than the SoGive Gold Standard of £5,000 per life saved.\n- For this reason, it is likely that a donation to HKI’s vitamin A supplementation programmes will achieve around as much positive impact as the same amount of money given to another Gold-rated organisation.\n- We have not reviewed the work of HKI outside of their vitamin A programmes. We therefore recommend donations be directed towards their vitamin A programmes. \n\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n\n**More about what HKI does - how they spend your donations**\n\nHKI supports government-run vitamin A supplementation (VAS) programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. As [noted](https://www.givewell.org/charities/helen-keller-international#What_is_Helen_Keller-s_role_in_VAS_programs) by charity analysis organisation GiveWell, HKI’s support to government-run VAS programmes includes: \n- Technical assistance: HKI assists governments with monitoring and evaluation, training health workers and managers, policy design, planning and budgeting, and social mobilization for VAS programmes. HKI mainly focuses on providing technical assistance at the sub-national level, particularly to districts or regions that may have low VAS coverage rates.\n- Advocacy: HKI encourages national governments to prioritize budgeting for and implementing VAS mass campaigns, and advocates for routine distribution of vitamin A supplements through health facilities.\n- Funding: HKI provides grants to governments to cover a portion of the implementation costs of VAS programmes.\n\nIn 2019, for their VAS programmes, HKI [spent](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jq0aJTK1h6Lzu8-BM5UhdxGsLzFuQcX5ZjLSMLtVxo8/edit#gid\u003d78474314) 26% of their expenditure on grants to governments for programme implementation (c. £1,133,000), 23% on personnel costs (c. £1,031,000), 19% on overhead costs (c. £836,000), 15% on programme implementation and monitoring (c. £681,000), 3% on travel, equipment and supplies (c. £111,000), and 14% on other direct costs (c. £626,000).\n\nOur understanding from their [annual report](https://www.hki.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2019_Annual_Report.pdf) is that HKI’s VAS programmes reached around 45 million children in 2019. \n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does HKI compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of HKI under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nThere is strong evidence from a [Cochrane review](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008524.pub3/full), a meta-analysis of 19 randomised controlled trials, that VAS reduces child mortality. As explained in our [in-depth analysis of VAS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XQPgg04ZAYJFxV2MshULRbb_N7f7YzWvyCX3po7HaNQ/edit#), we interpret the meta-analysis using the random-effects model. This model finds that VAS causes a 24% reduction in child mortality (95% confidence interval: 17% to 31% reduction). A recent, large trial in India, DEVTA, does not find a statistically significant effect of VAS on child mortality. However, this trial is included in the Cochrane review meta-analysis. We therefore remain confident that VAS reduces child mortality by around 24% on average. We conclude that the delivery of VAS and populations involved may explain the differing effectiveness between DEVTA and other past trials. Furthermore, there do not appear to be any major negative effects of VAS. \n\nIn our [in-depth analysis of HKI](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wGp2M22ldXj2SlJHO4DvSK-jkaleEskStT_dO7AjGdQ/edit#), we also apply an external validity adjustment to the results from the Cochrane review. This downward adjustment accounts for the predicted effectiveness of VAS in current HKI programmes. Overall, we still find that VAS is likely to substantially reduce child mortality in current contexts. VAS programmes are currently targeted towards regions with sufficiently high prevalence of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) and sufficiently high baseline mortality rates for VAS-preventable diseases (primarily measles and diarrhoea). We are also confident that vitamin A supplements are delivered to and ingested by most recipients, and that HKI plays a key role in ensuring coverage rates (the proportion of targeted populations who ingest the supplements) are high. \n\nOur cost-effectiveness analysis, which builds on the work of [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models), suggests that HKI\u0027s VAS programmes avert the death of a child for [£2,151](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16X57rHmYiMseoc-CXZF5TKzXNIK3bj-gNkQwPnN8cpk/edit#gid\u003d1070538669\u0026range\u003dB254). This reflects the fact that supplements only cost $2.18 (~£1.59) per child per year for two doses, in combination with the strong evidence that VAS reduces child mortality. In addition, the cost per child’s life saved estimate of £2,151 does not take into account the potential development benefits of VAS, which may lead to increases in future income as adults. GiveWell [estimates](https://www.givewell.org/charities/helen-keller-international#Is_there_room_for_more_funding) that HKI could use more funding than it currently expects to receive for VAS mass campaigns, up to an additional $56.9 million in 2022-24. \n\nFor these reasons, it is likely that a donation to HKI’s VAS programmes will achieve enough positive impact to be considered a Gold-rated organisation.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\nWe have not reviewed the work of HKI outside of their VAS programmes. We therefore recommend donations be directed towards their VAS programmes. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Helen Keller International’s vitamin A supplementation programmes as Gold (firm) under the SoGive methodology. \n",
