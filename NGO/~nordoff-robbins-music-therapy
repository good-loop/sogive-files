  "description": "As the UKâ€™s largest music therapy charity, we use music to enrich the lives of people with life-limiting illness, disabilities or feelings of isolation. We are dedicated to investigating the impact that music therapy can have for those affected by life-limiting illness, isolation or disability, and this work ensures that our practice is effective and led by the real experiences of the people we support. And we work hard to bring the benefits of music therapy to as many people as possible.",
