  "description": "Prostate Cancer UK is a UK-based charity with the aim of preventing deaths and suffering from prostate cancer. They do this primarily by funding scientific research and by raising awareness of prostate cancer risk. They also work on a variety of other programs, such as running a helpline staffed by specialist nurses, monitoring access to healthcare services related to prostate cancer, and advocating for the approval of new treatment options.",
  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**Prostate Cancer UK is rated as Not Recommended (tentative) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- Prostate Cancer UK funds medical research, raises awareness of prostate cancer, and supports and advocates for men with prostate cancer.\n- We estimate that money spent on cancer research is typically about 10x less cost-effective than our Gold standard, and we do not have any evidence that Prostate Cancer UK’s research spending is more effective than typical spending in this area. \n- We are concerned that in some cases, awareness and advocacy campaigns may not be beneficial to public health overall. \n- For these reasons, we tentatively rate Prostate Cancer UK as Not Recommended.\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what Prostate Cancer UK does - how they spend your donations**\n\nAccording to their [2021 annual report](https://prostatecanceruk.org/media/0s0fhgsn/annual-report-2020-2021.pdf), Prostate Cancer UK’s spending over the past year was approximately 40% on funding research, 40% on raising awareness, and 20% on support and advocacy. \n\nProstate Cancer UK made 15 new research grants in the past year, totalling close to £6 million. These grants support labs and scientists who are developing and evaluating new methods of diagnosing or treating prostate cancer. Some of these grant programs also have more specific field-building goals: for example, grants to early-career scientists, which may help them establish careers in prostate cancer research, or grants aimed at the treatment of localised prostate cancer, which Prostate Cancer UK considers an especially underfunded research area.\n\nOver the past year, Prostate Cancer UK spent approximately as much on awareness programs as on research funding, but it is somewhat less clear from their annual report how the awareness money was spent and what was achieved. They note successful online engagement, with 4.5 million visitors to their website, which represents a 40% increase compared to the previous year. About 160,000 people used an online risk checker tool which Prostate Cancer UK developed, and about 100,000 of those received a recommendation to speak with their GP about prostate cancer risk. \n\nTheir third program area, support and advocacy, covers both support for men currently facing prostate cancer, and longer-term advocacy for improved health care services related to prostate cancer. In addition to providing health information on their website and in publications, Prostate Cancer UK employs Specialist Nurses who are available by phone, chat, and email to answer questions and provide support. These Specialist Nurses fielded approximately 15,000 requests over the past year. In longer-term advocacy, Prostate Cancer UK is campaigning for a national prostate cancer screening program, and for the approval of new drug treatments for prostate cancer. Throughout the past year, while the healthcare system has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, Prostate Cancer UK has monitored access to prostate cancer screenings and treatments, and provided guidelines for clinicians on how to prioritise prostate cancer during this time.\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Prostate Cancer UK compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of Prostate Cancer UK’s work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold rating, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as a life saved for every £5000, or a year of depression averted for every £200) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nFunding scientific research accounts for about 40% of Prostate Cancer UK’s annual spending, or about £8.8 million over the past year. This figure includes the amount paid directly in grants, the costs of raising funds, and other support costs such as the costs of administering grants. Our view at SoGive is that money spent on cancer research, while beneficial, is about 10x less cost-effective than our Gold Standard. That is, money donated to a Gold-rated organisation would give people about ten times as many years of healthy life, compared to donating the same amount of money to cancer research. See [here](https://app.sogive.org/#charity?charityId\u003dcancer-research-uk) for more about this estimate.\n\nAwareness efforts account for another 40% of annual spending, or about £8.7 million over the past year. As mentioned above, we do not have many details about how this money was spent or how many people were reached, which we would need for a confident estimate of cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, while awareness campaigns aim to increase the number of people receiving prostate cancer screening, the question of whether more people should be screened for prostate cancer is controversial in the medical community. See for example [this overview](http://www.iacld.com/UpFiles/Documents/292098348.pdf), which explains how the harmful side-effects of treating cancers that would never have caused symptoms may outweigh the benefits of screening. Indeed, Prostate Cancer UK [recognise](https://prostatecanceruk.org/prostate-information/prostate-tests/psa-test) that there are both advantages and disadvantages to screening for prostate cancer using the PSA test. For this reason, it is unclear whether awareness campaigns are beneficial overall. \n\nLastly, support and advocacy efforts account for about 20% of annual spending, or about £4.6 million over the past year. This category covers a wide range of different charitable activities, so further breakdown of these costs is needed in order to confidently assess their cost-effectiveness. For example, we do not know the costs of running the Specialist Nurses program, so even though we know how many people the program reached last year, we cannot evaluate whether it is a cost-effective way of providing advice and support. To evaluate the longer-term advocacy efforts, we would need, in addition to a breakdown of costs, more information on the expected benefits: for example, the reasons why Prostate Cancer UK is pushing for certain drugs to be approved even though the regulators did not find those drugs to be beneficial, safe, and cost-effective.\n\nDue to our estimate of the value of typical cancer research and our uncertainties about whether pushing for more prostate cancer screenings and drug approvals is beneficial to public health overall, we currently assign Prostate Cancer UK a tentative rating of Not Recommended. In order to recommend Prostate Cancer UK in the future, we would want to see evidence that the research they choose to fund is considerably more valuable than typical cancer research, and evidence that their awareness campaigns and drug approval campaigns improve public health overall, as well as more detailed breakdowns of their activities and spending.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Prostate Cancer UK as Not Recommended (tentative) under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective.\n- We do have some indication of cost-effectiveness, and believe that cost-effectiveness underperforms the Gold Standard, likely by a substantial margin.\n",
