  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**Versus Arthritis is rated as Not Recommended (Tentative) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- Versus Arthritis is the UK\u0027s largest charity dedicated to supporting people with arthritis (whose main symptoms are joint pain and stiffness).\n- Assuming the annual impact of global arthritis research is equivalent to mitigating all the disease burden concerning osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout during one year, it is estimated that Versus Arthritis research would avert the loss of about 760k years of healthy life per year.\n- Supposing the annual impact of Versus Arthritis information, services and awareness work is equivalent to mitigating all the disease burden in the UK concerning osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout during one year, it would avert the loss of about 400k years of healthy life per year.\n- Considering that averting 50 years of healthy life is equivalent to saving one life, the charity annual impact would be equivalent to saving roughly 20k lives. \n- Given the charity’s expenditure of £43.2M on the two aforementioned activities, the above outcome would imply an average cost of £2k per life saved, which is below the SoGive Gold Standard of £5k per life saved.\n- While there may be positive impacts on well-being from Versus Arthritis activities, we are tempted to believe these do not achieve an outcome as good as averting the UK burden of disease of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout for one year.\n- For this reason, it is likely that a donation to Versus Arthritis will achieve less positive impact than the same amount of money given to a Gold-rated organisation.\n\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n\n**More about what Versus Arthritis does - how they spend your donations**\n\nVersus Arthritis was formed in 2018 following a merger of Arthritis Care and Arthritis Research UK. It has the following 6 ambitions ([2019/2020 annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA10797665\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d207711)):\n- \"The impact of arthritis is recognised, and as a result, people with arthritis are empowered and supported to demand more\" (p. 8).\n- \"Every child and young person with arthritis is supported by us\" (p. 10).\n- \"Pain and the impact of pain does not limit the lives of people with arthritis\" (p. 12).\n- \"There is a galvanised community pushing against arthritis\" (p. 14).\n- \"Wherever you are in the UK, there is a local touchpoint with us\" (p. 16).\n- \"MSK [musculoskeletal] research has an even greater impact on the quality of life for people with arthritis\" (p. 17).\n\nThe total expenditure of £49.1M for the year ending 31 March 2020 was allocated as follows ([2019/2020 annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA10797665\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d207711), p. 47):\n- Research (46%). This includes securing funding for arthritis-related research projects, and supporting the undertaking of original research in one of the Versus Arthritis research centres (mostly located at universities), and the development of solutions to manage arthritis symptoms and well-being (e.g. STarTBack).\n- Information, services and awareness (41%). This includes advertising to change the public attitude towards arthritis, campaigning to put arthritis at the forefront of the Government’s agenda, personal advising services, distance support via a helpline, and physical activity programmes designed to reduce pain, amongst others.\n- Raising funds (10%).\n- Investment management costs and product ventures (1.8%).\n\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Versus Arthritis compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of Versus Arthritis under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nFurther information about the impact of Versus Arthritis charitable activities on the beneficiaries, especially of its campaigning and research work, would be needed in order to estimate its overall cost-effectiveness more accurately. Nevertheless, an upper bound could be estimated assuming:\n- The impact of the global arthritis research is equivalent to mitigating all the disease burden concerning osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis ([the 2 most common types of arthritis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/arthritis/)) and gout during 2019 (but not afterwards), which are the 3 types of arthritis considered in the cause \"musculoskeletal disorders\" (B.11) in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. \n- The contribution of UK’s arthritis research to this impact is proportional to the ratio between the UK health GERD (gross domestic expenditure on research and development) and the global health GERD.\n- The contribution of Versus Arthritis’ research to the UK’s arthritis research is proportional to the ratio between the expenditure related to health of the private non-profit sector in the UK and UK health GERD.\n- The impact of Versus Arthritis’ information, services and awareness work is equivalent to mitigating all the disease burden in the UK concerning the 3 aforementioned types of arthritis.\n\n\"Burden of disease\" refers to the combined effect of mortality and morbidity, and can be measured in \"Disability Adjusted Life Years\" (DALYs). \"Conceptually, one DALY is the equivalent of losing one year in good health because of either premature death or disease or disability. One DALY represents one lost year of healthy life\" ([OWID](https://ourworldindata.org/burden-of-disease)). According to [GBD 2019](https://www.healthdata.org/gbd/2019), the global burden of disease for the 3 aforementioned types of arthritis [were](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool?params\u003dgbd-api-2019-permalink/f07ab540374abcb164699f2b96b7ebe0):\n- Osteoarthritis: 314.5k DALYs in the UK, and 18.95M DALYs globally.\n- Rheumatoid arthritis: 66.7k DALYs in the UK, and 3.26M DALYs globally.\n- Gout: 21.8k DALYs in the UK, and 1.67M DALYs globally.\nConsequently, averting 23.9M DALYs is the hypothesised upper bound for the annual impact of the global arthritis research, and 403k DALYs is the upper bound for the annual impact of Versus Arthritis information, services and awareness work. \n\nThe ratio between the UK health GERD and the global health GERD was estimated to be 10.9% (\u003d £13.1G / £120G). The UK health GERD of £8.67G (9 billions) in 2018, or $13.1G (\u003d 8.67kM * [1.3349](https://www.exchangerates.org.uk/GBP-USD-spot-exchange-rates-history-2018.html) * [1.13](https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/2018?amount\u003d1)), was taken from the [UK Health Research Analysis](https://hrcsonline.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/UK-Health-Research-Analysis-2018-for-web-v1-28Jan2020.pdf) (p. 125). The global health GERD was estimated to be $120G, by adding the following estimates for the health GERD by income group:\n- Low income countries: $0.0851G, 0.02% of the 2018 GDP of $0.426T (0.4 trillions).\n- Lower-middle income countries: $0.735G, 0.01% of the 2018 GDP of $7.35T.\n- Upper-middle income countries: $4.73G, 0.02% of the 2018 GDP of $23.6T.\n- High income countries: $115G, 0.21% of the 2018 GDP of $54.6T.\nThe values for the health GERD as a fraction of the GDP were taken from the ([WHO](https://www.who.int/observatories/global-observatory-on-health-research-and-development/indicators/gross-domestic-r-d-expenditure-on-health-as-a-percent-of-gross-domestic-product)), and the GDP data from [The World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/?locations\u003dXM-XN-XT-XD). \n\nIt is also determined in the [UK Health Research Analysis](https://hrcsonline.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/UK-Health-Research-Analysis-2018-for-web-v1-28Jan2020.pdf) (p. 123) that the expenditure related to health of the private non-profit sector (charities) in the UK was £577M, which represents 6.66% (\u003d £577M / £8.67G) of the UK health GERD. As a consequence, assuming that Versus Arthritis was responsible for all the arthritis research respecting UK charities (what tends to overestimate its impact), it could be inferred that its research concerned 0.725% (\u003d 10.9% * 6.66%) of the global arthritis research. In other words, given Versus Arthritis’ expenditure on research of £22.8M, the global spending (for which a direct source could not be found) is expected to be £3.1G (\u003d £22.8M / 0.725%). This means averting 173k DALYs (\u003d 0.725% * 23.9M) is the hypothesised upper bound for the annual impact of Versus Arthritis research.\n\nIn order to convert DALYs to lives saved, it is considered that saving one life is [equivalent to averting 50 -DALYs](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/technical-updates-our-global-health-and-wellbeing-cause-prioritization-framework#Measurement_of_DALYs) (following the GBD approach would result in using a conversion factor of [more than 80 DALYs per life saved](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/technical-updates-our-global-health-and-wellbeing-cause-prioritization-framework#How_we_previously_compared_health_and_income), which would imply a higher cost per life saved). This means the impact of Versus Arthritis research is equivalent to saving roughly 3.46k lives (\u003d 173k / 50), and that of its information, services and awareness work to saving about 8.06k lives (\u003d 403k / 50). As a result, the total impact of Versus Arthritis is equivalent to saving 11.5k lives, or averting the burden of disease of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout in the UK for 17 months (\u003d 11.5k / 8.06k * 12). \n\nBased on the numbers of lives saved determined above, the expenditure on research of £22.8M, and the expenditure on information, services and awareness of £20.4M, the upper bounds for the cost-effectiveness are:\n- For the research, £7k per life saved (\u003d £22.8M / 3.46k).\n- For the information, services and awareness, £3k per life saved (\u003d £20.4M / 8.06k).\n- For these two activities, £4k per life saved (\u003d (£22.8M + £20.4M) / 11.5k).\n\nThis cost-effectiveness is similar to the SoGive Gold Standard of £5k per life saved. Nevertheless, while there may be positive impacts on well-being from Versus Arthritis activities, we are tempted to believe these do not achieve an outcome as good as averting the burden of disease of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout in the UK for over one year. Based on ([these GBD data](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool?params\u003dgbd-api-2019-permalink/33bdabcbb2df7b975e7dc69e525d12a7)), from 1990 to 2019, the age-standardised DALYs per capita in the UK and globally increased 0.7% (\u003d (275.41 + 64.09 + 19.96) / (257.33 + 82.08 + 17.40) - 1) and 10% (\u003d (227.97 + 64.09 + 20.23) / (220.68 + 39.12 + 16.55) - 1).\n\nFurther information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion about Versus Arthritis would be:\n- Metrics describing the overall impact of the charity, such as the total number of people helped, and information about the average improvement in quality and length of life for people with arthritis as a result of the research they fund and the support services they provide. \n- Impact evaluation of the information, services and awareness work based on adequately powered studies, preferably randomised controlled trials, and ideally assessing the long-term impact of their interventions.\n- Clear breakdown of the costs of the research, information, services and awareness interventions.\n- Theory of change for the campaigning and research work, including an assessment of the extent of their impact, and a description of the contribution of other actors external to Versus Arthritis (such as the NHS as well as other organisations that fund research). This involves some challenges, as we have pointed out in an earlier [analysis](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/is-it-better-to-fund-direct-work-or.html?view\u003dsidebar), even if [arthritis is underfunded](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2017/08/donating-to-medical-research-heres-why.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Versus Arthritis as Not Recommended (Tentative) under the SoGive methodology. \n",
