It is not defined or explained what these are or where they come from, however it may be appropriate to exclude this from the overall spend, if it means that the activity is partly self-funding. This would roughly halve the cost from 20ish pence per book to about 10 pence per book. This is a surprisingly low cost -- the accounts refer to a nominal cost of 5p per book, but this is not defined; i.e. we don\u0027t know what they mean by \"nominal cost\" (and haven\u0027t asked)",
