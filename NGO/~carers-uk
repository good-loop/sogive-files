  "recommendation": "[carers-uk]\n**Summary**\n\n**Carers UK is rated as More Information Needed on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- Carers UK provides advice and support for carers, campaigns around issues affecting carers, connects carers through support groups and works with organisations to improve carers services across the UK.\n- According to Carers UK’s website, over 6.5 million people in the UK are carers, which is around 1 in 8 adults. This data is taken from the [2011 Census](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/QS301UK/view/2092957697?cols\u003dmeasures), where the options for the amount of unpaid care provided per week were: 0-19 hours (4 million people); 19-49 hours (900,000); 50 or more (1.5 million).\n- The total amount of people receiving Carers Allowance in England, Scotland and Wales at [February 2021 was 1.3 million](https://www.google.com/url?q\u003dhttps://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/dwp-benefits-statistics-august-2021/dwp-benefits-statistics-august-2021%23:~:text%3DThe%2520total%2520number%2520of%2520people,but%2520do%2520not%2520receive%2520payments\u0026sa\u003dD\u0026source\u003ddocs\u0026ust\u003d1661356110994037\u0026usg\u003dAOvVaw1gherCXaj0iwbvTBAjdGR9), which includes 370,000 (28%) people who were entitled to the benefit but did not receive payments. To receive Carers Allowance, an individual must be providing over 35 hours of unpaid care per week.\n- In 2021, Carers UK spent £4 million across three charitable areas: Giving Carers a stronger voice; Providing Carers with support; and Education, Influence and Training.\n- As Carers UK have provided no detailed information on activities carried out in each of these categories, including outcomes or costs, we are unable to compare them to our Gold Standard benchmarks.\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what Carers UK does - how they spend your donations**\n\nCarers UK provides advice, information and support to carers through their online information and telephone advice and support service. They campaign on issues affecting carers, such as their Fairer for Carers campaign which aims to increase the carers allowance and conducts research around issues affecting carers in the UK. Through their carers groups and volunteers Carers UK aims to reach local communities and offer support networks and they work with other organisations and local authorities to improve carers services. In their [2021 annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA11269325\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d246329) they detail a total spend of £4 million and break down their charitable activities and spending into three categories: Giving Carers a stronger voice (31% of their charitable expenditure, giving £1.2 million of non-project adjusted costs); Providing Carers with support (37% of their charitable expenditure giving £1.5 million of non-project adjusted costs); and Education, Influence and Training (32% of their charitable expenditure, giving £1.3 million on project adjusted costs). We will assume that ‘Providing Carers with support’ accounts for their direct support and advice work. In their 2021 annual report they state that during the year over 20,000 calls were answered by their UK helpline and there were 3.2 million views on their help and advice section of their website. There is no further information provided on outcomes from these charitable activities specific to each category.\n\nOn their website Carers UK state that they have been campaigning with carers for over 50 years, transforming understanding and winning critical developments in carers rights. One of their ongoing campaigns is called a [‘Right to Carers Leave’](https://www.carersuk.org/news-and-campaigns/campaigns/right-to-carers-leave) which led to the government pledging to introduce one week unpaid leave for paid employees in 2020. Although Carers UK saw that as a step in the right direction they also think it would be more constructive if it was paid leave, with their goal being up to 10 days paid leave with an option for 6 months unpaid leave. In 2022, a Private Member\u0027s Bill on Carer’s Leave entitled ‘Bill to make provision about unpaid leave for employees with caring responsibilities’ was introduced by the Liberal Democrat MP, Wendy Chamberlain. Carer’s UK are working closely with Wendy Chamberlain MP to try and make sure the Bill becomes law. From their research they estimate that at least 2.34 million employees who are carers could gain rights from passing this bill and that around 1.4 million employers would have to consider their existing or create carer-related policies. Another recent campaign, conducted in 2020, was their [‘Caring behind closed doors’ research](https://www.carersuk.org/news-and-campaigns/campaigns/caring-behind-closed-doors), which showed an increased pressure on carers during the pandemic due to factors such as increased caring responsibilities, the need for self isolation/shielding and closure of local support services. As a result of this research the Scottish Government made an additional payment of £230 in June 2020 to people receiving Carers Support Allowance, which was around 80,000 people. \n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Carers UK compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of Carers UK’s work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold rating, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nAs Carers UK have provided no information on outcomes from their activities, specific to each of their three categories of spending, we cannot compare them to our benchmarks.\n\nAs at least 6.5 million people in the UK are carers, this does mean any campaigns that are successful and lead to policy changes have the potential to increase the quality of life for a large proportion of the population. From the [2011 Census](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/QS301UK/view/2092957697?cols\u003dmeasures) data the amount of people providing unpaid care is: 0-19 hours (4 million people); 19-49 hours (900,000); 50 or more (1.5 million). Carer’s UK expects these figures to rise with the incoming 2021 Census Data and they ran a [campaign](https://www.carersuk.org/news-and-campaigns/campaigns/census-2021) encouraging carers to identify themselves in the census. With 1.3 million people claiming Carer’s Allowance in England, Scotland and Wales at [February 2021](https://www.google.com/url?q\u003dhttps://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/dwp-benefits-statistics-august-2021/dwp-benefits-statistics-august-2021%23:~:text%3DThe%2520total%2520number%2520of%2520people,but%2520do%2520not%2520receive%2520payments\u0026sa\u003dD\u0026source\u003ddocs\u0026ust\u003d1661356110994037\u0026usg\u003dAOvVaw1gherCXaj0iwbvTBAjdGR9),it appears that there are people entitled to this benefit that are not claiming for it. On their ‘Right to Carers Leave’ webpage they recognise the pledge to introduce paid leave was in part due to ‘the work of other organisations in raising the issue’ and this is an important point. As there are other organisations campaigning on behalf of carers, we cannot be sure how much of the policy changes were directly due to Carers UK’s campaign work. In their future strategy, published in 2021 and entitled ‘[Vision 2025 - our five-year direction of travel](https://www.carersuk.org/component/cck/?task\u003ddownload\u0026collection\u003dfile_list\u0026xi\u003d0\u0026file\u003ddocument\u0026id\u003d5886) they write: ‘It can perhaps be assumed that the 4.5 million people who were new to caring overnight, as a consequence of the coronavirus, may not remain carers long term as services reopen, paid support returns or shielding of the most vulnerable ends and overall figures could decrease.’ They do go on to discuss how to harness the support of the people who found themselves caring during the pandemic, so although the number of people affected by the policy changes could decrease, there are potentially more supporters of policy changes for carers. \n\nIn addition to their ‘Vision 2025’, they have provided detailed information on their plans for 2022 in their annual report, such as researching and reporting on key topic areas for carers including the ongoing effect of the COVID-19 crisis, but we cannot determine which of the three categories the plans listed will fall under.\n\nTo be able to compare Carers UK to our benchmarks, further information would be needed and would include:\n\n- A more detailed overview of projects and their associated costs included in each of the three categories: Giving Carers a stronger voice; Providing Carers with support; and Education, Influence and Training. \n- Research into how many carers know about Carers UK and engage with the charity for support and advice.\n-  An estimate of what the funds used for these policy changes would have been directed towards, had there been no such policies. The government has a set amount of money to spend, so the money dedicated to these policy changes must come from somewhere. Is this at the detriment of a policy that has the potential to do more good?\n- Specific outcomes for each project. For example: how many carers were supported during the year, how were they supported and how did this help them?; how much progress has Carers UK made in its campaigns in a year and what are the expected changes from these campaigns?. \n- An analysis of organisations campaigning on behalf of carers in the UK. This would help us determine what would happen if Carer’s UK didn’t exist i.e. what is the likelihood that campaigns addressing these issues would have been conducted by another organisation and the same outcomes would have been achieved within a similar timeframe? Also we should consider whether Carers UK are more or less cost-effective at campaigning than other organisations.\n- A fuller analysis would also assess management capability. For example, this would involve assessing Carers UK’s capabilities around Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning to ensure they are learning from their mistakes, and understanding how the leadership sets strategy and selects projects; in particular, how does the charity incorporate cost-effectiveness thinking into its strategic decisions.\n\nFor more information on how we would conduct cost-effectiveness analysis of their campaign work if they provided more data on outputs under our 3 question method please click [here.](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-three-question-method-for.html?q\u003dresearch\u0026view\u003dsidebar)\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze ratings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Carers UK as More Information Needed under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective\n- We have no indication of cost-effectiveness, or we do not judge those indications to be promising",
