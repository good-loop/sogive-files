  "recommendation": "**To evaluate Carers UK under the SoGive rating methodology, we would need more information.**\n\nThis charity brings advice and support to carers looking after loved ones in old age, in poor health or affected by disabilities. Carers UK gives expert advice to carers, builds up a social network among carers, influences policymakers who affect carers\u0027 lives, and searches for creative ways to help carers in the future. According to the 2018/19 report, the charity has three projects. Carers UK spends roughly 38% of its charitable expenses on \"providing carers with support,\" 33% on \"education, influence, and training,\" and 29% on \"giving carers a stronger voice.\"\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-sogive-approach-to-assessing.html), we consider two questions:\n- how much does it cost for the charity to do something\n- what is the thing (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)\n\n**More about what Carers UK does**\n\nWe could not gather enough information from the 2018/19 annual report to perform a detailed analysis or form opinions about their work under the SoGive methodology. Our inability to produce an evaluation arises from a lack of comprehensive quantitative data on the outputs of the charity\u0027s projects.\n\nFurthermore, the charity spends a not-insignificant amount (29-62%) of funds on campaigning. The charity\u0027s [campaigns](https://www.carersuk.org/component/cck/?task\u003ddownload\u0026collection\u003dfile_list\u0026xi\u003d0\u0026file\u003ddocument\u0026id\u003d2743) pushes policymakers to give carers more paid care leaves and raise carers\u0027 allowance in general. The latter may benefit 750,000 carers. Campaigns\u0027 influence often proves difficult to assess, which we have pointed out in an earlier [analysis](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/is-it-better-to-fund-direct-work-or.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\n**Benchmarking**\n\nAfter a review of the work of Carers UK under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process would involve comparing the charity to benchmark charities. These benchmark charities have strong cost-effectiveness and evidence for their effectiveness. These benchmark charities should achieve an outcome about as good as saving a life for around £1,500. An example benchmark charity is the [Against Malaria Foundation](https://app.sogive.org/#charity?charityId\u003dagainst-malaria-foundation). However, because of a lack of information in the charity\u0027s annual report, we ended up unable to perform the comparison.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe would need more information to determine whether Carers UK would lead to an impact more positive than saving a life for about £1,500.\n\nFurther information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion of the work of Carers UK would include a clearer and more comprehensive impact assessment, which would answer some of the following questions:\n\nWhat exactly distinguishes funds that go into \"education, influence, and training\" and \"giving carers a stronger voice?\" How much progress has Carers UK made in its campaigns in a year? How many carers would potentially get paid leave because of the charity\u0027s campaigns and not because of other people\u0027s efforts? How much paid leave and how much allowance, in general, would carers get? How exactly do these policy benefits help carers and the people they care for? What would have the funds used for these policies been directed towards, had there been no such policies?\n\nSimilar questions can be asked about the charity\u0027s direct work. How many carers has the charity directly helped during the financial year, and what are the impacts on the carers and the people they care for?\n\nUltimately, what would happen if the charity did not provide its services? Why is this worth being done by a charity and not by the NHS?",
