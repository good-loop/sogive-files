  "recommendation": "**The National Theatre achieves a Bronze assessment under the SoGive rating methodology.**\n\nThe National Theatre promote theatre in the UK, by producing plays and running several outreach activities.\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-sogive-approach-to-assessing.html),  we consider two questions:\n- how much does it cost for the charity to do something\n- what is the thing (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)\n\n**More about what The National Theatre does**\n\nBased on the information we have gathered from the 2019 accounts, we understand that it cost The National Theatre around Â£61m to produce its plays and tours. They also spent Â£6.4m to make their work available virtually, such as cinema broadcasts and a free streaming service for schools. In 2019, this collectively may have reached up to 7.2m people world wide.\n\nMoreover, The National Theatre supports theatres in schools. This includes organising festivals for youth theatre groups and providing support for primary school teachers. Lastly, The National Theatre also engages in advocacy for Creative Education. This includes advising regulatory organisations and offering professional development for teachers and people in the theatre industry.\n\n**Benchmarking**\n\nHaving reviewed The National Theatre\u0027s work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process is to compare this to benchmark charities. These benchmark charities have strong cost-effectiveness and evidence for their effectiveness. For these benchmark charities, you should be able to achieve an outcome about as good as saving a life for around Â£1,500. An example benchmark charity is the [Against Malaria Foundation](https://app.sogive.org/#charity?charityId\u003dagainst-malaria-foundation)\n\nIn performing the comparison, we have focused on the \"Performances\" and \"Live \u0026 Digital\" area of The National Theatre\u0027s work, which together constitutes over three-quarters of its charitable activities, as per the 2019 accounts. While this seems reasonable, it\u0027s possible that the impact of the marginal pound donated to The National Theatre could be related to campaigning and learning could have a different level of impactfulness if it is used for learning or advocacy activities.\n\nLearning and advocacy activities are harder to assess. A true analysis of the impact of campaigning needs to consider counterfactuals. E.g. if The National Theatre successfully persuaded the government to spend more money to support the arts, what would that money have achieved if The National Theatre had not successfully redirected the funds? However, the campaigning element of The National Theater\u0027s work is small and probably would not affect the result of our analysis.\n\n**Conclusion**\nIf it costs around Â£9 for someone to engage with The National Theatre\u0027s work, by either attending a live performance or watching it virtually, then Â£1,500 could fund just over 160 people. We believe that 160 people watching a theatre play is likely to be less positive an outcome than saving someone\u0027s life. (possibly bronze once research is done)\n\nFor reference, when we describe a charity as Bronze-rated, we mean that\n- we expect, but cannot prove, that the charity\u0027s work likely has a positive impact\n- we have good reason to believe that the charity underperforms a Gold-rated charity (i.e. achieves less positive impact per pound donated than a Gold-rated charity)\n",
