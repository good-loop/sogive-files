  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n \n**The Royal National Theatre is rated as Not Recommended (Firm) on the SoGive rating scale.**\n\n- The Royal National Theatre promotes theatre in the UK and beyond by making it more accessible, organising plays, and engaging in outreach activities.\n- Examples of the range of work undertaken include hosting theatre works through tours across the UK and cinema broadcasts, offering streaming services, providing accessible ticket pricing, investing in new talent, and promoting theatre in schools.\n- Taking figures on the two biggest sources of spending at face value, Royal National Theatre spends an average of Â£17 per person for live shows and Â£2 per person for digital shows.\n- To meet SoGiveâs Gold Standard, a single visit to a theatre play would have to achieve an improvement in wellbeing equivalent to averting 30 days of severe depression. While attending theatre may have positive effects on wellbeing, we do not believe it is likely that these match the effects of a Gold Standard organization.\n- For this reason, we rate Royal National Theatre as Not Recommended (Firm).\n \n**More about what Royal National Theatre does - how they spend your donations**\n\nThe [annual report for financial year 2019-2020]( https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA10883414\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d224223) (ending March 29 2020) lists five types of charitable expenditure, which together make up Â£36.8m (Â£93.2m before subtracting trading costs and income from beneficiaries).  \n\n*Live Performances* \n\nThe biggest source of spending is Live Performances, which include shows in UK Theatres, on Broadway New York, and tours around the world. In total, they received Â£29.4m in spending, about 72% of the charityâs total expenditure. About 1.74m people saw a live production (p.03). \n\n*NT Live and Digital*\n\nNT Live and Digital comprises both digital live streams of shows around the world and cinema broadcasts in the UK. In total, it received Â£4.7m in spending, about 11% of total spending, and reached 2.57m people (p.03).\n \n*NT Learning and Public Engagement*\n\nIn their NT Learning \u0026 Public Engagement projects, Royal National Theatre focuses both on promoting theatre in schools around the UK and supporting upcoming artists. In total, they received Â£1.7m in spending, which is about 4.5% of total spending. 152 schools took part in a programme to create school plays, and about 6,000 young people took part in youth theatre festivals (p.03). \n\n*NT Research and Development and miscellaneous expenditure*\n\nNT Research and Development provides support and training for upcoming artists. In total, these projects received Â£0.8m in spending, which is about 2% of total spending. Over 1,000 artists were provided training and development through the New Work Department, which is part of NT Research and Development (p. 45). Lastly, NT Major Projects covers miscellaneous expenditures such as fitting LED lighting in theatres (p.21). In total, it received Â£0.2m in spending, which is less than 0.5% of total spending.\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Royal National Theatre compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nTo review the work of Royal National Theatre under the two-question method, we analyse costs per output and compare this to SoGiveâs Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as Â£5,000 per life saved, or Â£200 to avert a year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar)\n \nIf we consider the two main areas of spending, which together make up around 83%\nof total spending, we find the following:\n- For Live Performances, Â£29.4m was used to reach 1.74m people in 2019/2020, so the average cost per person reached is around Â£17.\n- For NT Live \u0026 Digital services, Â£4.7m was used to reach 2.57m people in 2020, so the average cost per person reached is around Â£2.\n \nIn order for Royal National Theatre to be as cost-effective as a SoGive Gold\nStandard rated organization, subsidising an individualâs theatre attendance would have to amount to an improvement in wellbeing equivalent to averting a month of severe depression (200/17\u003d~12, 365/12\u003d 30). By the same reasoning, subsidising an individualâs digital theatre attendance would have to amount to an improvement in wellbeing equivalent to averting 3 to 4 days of severe depression (200/2\u003d100, 365/100\u003d3.65). While we think it is possible that attending theatre physically or digitally has positive effects on wellbeing, we do not believe it is likely that these match the effects of a Gold Standard organization Further evidence may lead us to consider the effects of theatre attendance more favorably.\n \nBesides direct effects on wellbeing, Royal National Theatre also aims to have indirect benefits for individuals and society by promoting theatre as an art form and cultural heritage. While these may be real benefits, they are less tangible, both in terms of how Royal National Theatre affects the promotion of theatre as an art form and how this could benefit individuals. We remain open however to evidence from Royal National Theatre that the work they do is particularly valuable in comparison to other cultural organizations. It is also important to consider what would happen if the Royal National Theatre stopped receiving donations. A possibility is that other sources of funding would fill the gap in the absence of donations to Royal National Theatre, such as government or Arts Council National Lottery funds. Another possibility is that we would simply see an increase in ticket prices. \n \n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Royal National Theatre as Not Recommended (Firm) under SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charityâs work is effective.\n- We do have some indication of cost-effectiveness and have very high confidence that cost-effectiveness underperforms the Gold Standard, likely by a substantial margin.\n\n",
