  "recommendation": "**Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity is rated as Not Recommended (Firm) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\nGreat Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) Children\u0027s Charity supports various activities linked to the hospital, such as caring for patients, their families, and staff, rebuilding and refurbishing, providing medical equipment, and research.\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-sogive-approach-to-assessing.html), we consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)\n\n\n**More about what Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity does**\n\nThe GOSH Charity’s objectives are to fund hospital services at Great Ormond Street Hospital and any other health services there (unless such funding would be provided by the statutory authorities), as well as research into children’s disease. This analysis is based on their [annual report 2019/20](https://media.gosh.org/documents/GOSH_Charity_Annual_Report_and_Accounts_2019-20.pdf).\n\nGOSH itself is part of the NHS and publishes its own separate [annual report](https://media.gosh.nhs.uk/documents/Great_Ormond_Street_Hospital_for_Children_FT_Annual_Report_2019_20_FINAL_to_Pa_DxsZyRk.pdf). It is a specialist, tertiary hospital and the NHS pays for most of the hospital’s patient care activities. Specifically, the NHS paid £393m or 87% of the hospital’s total revenue of £450m from patient care activities (GOSH AR, p. 36, p. 134). \n\nIn the 2019/20 financial year, GOSH Charity spent a total of £78.0m on donor-funded charitable activities. This includes consolidated funds from GOSH Charity’s fully owned subsidiaries Great Ormond Street International Promotions Ltd and Sparks Charity.\n\nGOSH Charity makes grants in four areas that augment the core treatment services provided by GOSH: Child and family support, rebuilding and refurbishment, medical equipment and systems, and research (p. 8). Expenditure for charitable activities is reported slightly differently, with Child and family support split among welfare and clinical development (which seemingly also includes staff support) and accommodation and other costs (p. 83).\n\nThe highest portion of spending (45% or £35m) goes to welfare and clinical development, followed by redevelopment (25% or £19m). The lowest portion of expenditure (7% or £5.5m) goes into research. Some of the overall spending (£42m, GOSH AR p. 151) is provided as direct income for GOSH. Other support comes in the form of services or property use (GOSH AR p. 126, p. 145).\n\nSome examples of supported activities are as follows:\n- In child and family support, the charity funds therapeutic play services that benefit around 500 children each day, preparing them for treatment and surgery. Accommodation and other expenses for parents of patients are also funded. In view of the pandemic measures, another initiative was to fund tablet devices to allow communication under visiting restrictions (GOSH AR, p. 20).\n- In staff support, the charity funds the GOSH Learning Academy which has provided training to 500 attendees in 2019/20.\nIn rebuilding and refurbishment, the charity has funded a new centre for about 8,000 children with sight or hearing loss that come to the hospital annually. \n- Funding for medical equipment and systems was used for a new iMRI scanner and digital support systems, for example.\n- In research, GOSH Charity’s work included eleven new child health research projects  with its subsidiary Sparks National Call and three projects with partner LifeArc. \n\nThe bulk of GOSH Charity’s income comes from donations and legacies (89%). \n\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis**\n\nTo review the work of GOSH Charity under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold-standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work.\n\nThe GOSH Charity annual report lacks detailed information about how spending is distributed among the various charitable activities as well as about the specific beneficial impact of these activities.\n\nBased on the current information, we would group the charity’s activities into two clusters:\nThe majority of GOSH Charity’s funding (76% or £59.5m) goes towards activities linked to improving the environment for patients and their family, as well as staff. These are the areas of welfare and clinical development, redevelopment, and \"accommodation and others\". GOSH provides around 250,000 appointments per year (GOSH AR, p. 7). Let us assume generously that there is only an average of 2 appointments per child, and for 25% of those children (31,250) an improvement in well-being equivalent to averting one year of severe depression can be achieved through the combination of GOSH Charity’s activities. Given the above cost of £59.5m, this results in a cost of £1,905 to improve well-being comparable to averting one year of severe depression. This is much higher than the benchmark of £200. This does not preclude the possibility that some individual activity out of the whole range of GOSH Charity’s activities is more effective.\n\nAs research and medical equipment contribute towards new and improved treatment, we would compare their impact against a benchmark of saving one life per £5,000 donated. However, only 24% of expenditure is spent on these combined areas and only 7% towards research. Our [analysis](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/is-it-better-to-fund-direct-work-or.html?view\u003dsidebar) suggests there are some tentative reasons to be positive about this work, but to make a judgement we would need to know which diseases GOSH Charity is addressing and with what expenditure.\n\nWhile GOSH Charity’s activities such as caring for patients and their families and providing medical equipment are likely to do some good, our default assumption is that a charity is unlikely to achieve substantial positive impact in the absence of strong evidence to the contrary. This is for the reasons set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/should-you-be-charity-sceptic.html?view\u003dsidebar). \n\nFor us to be able to say that GOSH Charity is as cost-effective as one of our benchmark charities, they would need to show that donating £200 to them would achieve an outcome as good as averting severe depression for a full year or donating £5,000 would save one life. Based on our judgement, the report contains no specific evidence of this sort. We will review this conclusion if more specific evidence of impact is provided about the effectiveness of GOSH Charity’s research or other activities.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity as Not Recommended (Firm) under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We have some indication of cost-effectiveness, and have very high confidence that cost-effectiveness underperforms the Gold Standard, likely by a substantial margin\n",
