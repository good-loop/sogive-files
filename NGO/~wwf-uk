  "recommendation": "**WWF UK is rated as More Information Needed on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\nWorld Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is one of the world\u0027s largest international conservation organisations. WWF’s mission is to create a world where people and wildlife can thrive together. WWF UK is a registered charity working in England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-sogive-approach-to-assessing.html), we consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)\n\n\n**More about what WWF UK does**\n\nWWF UK is part of the international non-governmental organisation World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), which was established in 1961 and now works in more than 100 countries. WWF International has 34 [national offices](https://wwf.panda.org/discover/about_wwf/how_were_run/), which raise their own funds and carry out work internationally. WWF UK as one of the national offices accounts for around 12% of global spending, according to the fund’s [international annual report 2020](https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/wwfintl_annualreview2020.pdf).\n\nIn the 2019/20 financial year ending on 30 June, WWF UK spent a total of about £78.3m on donor-funded charitable activities, according to their [annual report](https://www.wwf.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-01/WWF-UK_Annual_Report_and_Financial_Statements_2019-20.pdf) (AR). \n\nWWF UK organises its major activities around five main goals, which stayed the same from the last reporting period. The amount of spending per goal and corresponding activities are summarised as follows (AR p. 19):\n- Thriving habitats and species (39%): The main part of WWF’s spending goes towards halting the loss of habitats and rebuilding natural life-support systems for people and species. In this financial year, two focus areas were the SOKNOT landscape with the Mara river in Kenya and Tanzania as well as the river Yangtze in China.\n- Fight for your world (19%): This goal is about influencing people and political and economic systems to stop nature’s decline, mainly through campaigning. WWF UK launched the film \"A Life On Our Planet\", continued their climate campaign, launched a new food campaign and published a Global Futures report to influence global policy.\n- Growing support (19%): This goal is about engaging people directly and making WWF even more widely known. WWF UK published content on social media, for example regarding wildfires in the Amazon and in Australia, and built new platforms for interaction, such as their Amazing Planet offering.\n- Food for the future (8%): WWF aims to ensure the UK plays a leading role in the change towards more sustainable food production and consumption. Activities included working with Tesco and the University of Oxford to more reliably track the environmental impact of food systems.\n- Climate change and the polar regions (3%): In their engagement against climate change and for the preservation of the polar regions, WWF UK campaigns for a green recovery from the pandemic and maps arctic regions for preservation, among other activities.\n\nWWF UK’s reported successes of their work for the financial year 2019/20 (AR p. 6-9) include the following:\n- Area protection: The main result reported is Canada’s decision to protect the arctic marine region of Tuvaijuittuq, which covers about the same area as Germany, and which the WWF had lobbied for for many years. However, as this success is also mentioned in the annual report of [WWF Canada](https://wwf.ca/reports/2019-annual-report/), it is not clear which national organisations provided what funding and how substantial their influence was on the government’s decision.\n- Species conservation: Examples include tracking numbers of lions and mountain gorillas, as well as a large research study (ArcNet) to identify feeding areas for marine predators in Antarctica by tracking 4,000 individual animals.\n- Forest fire aid: £1m was spent in the Amazon and £3m in Australia, providing equipment and training to fight current and future fires and help the animals and humans affected.\n- Climate advocacy: Scotland passed tough new climate laws, which WWF UK claims is partially due to their continued campaigning. WWF also campaigns for changes to the way food is produced and labelled as well as calling for changes in land use and personal diets. The global food system is estimated to drive about 21-37% of emissions related to climate change (IPCC)[https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/chapter/summary-for-policymakers/].\n\nWWF UK’s funding comes mainly from donations and legacies (85%, AR p. 50).\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis**\n\nTo review the work of WWF UK under the two-question method, we analyse costs per output and compare this to SoGive’s Gold-standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5 to avert the suffering of one chicken living in very poor conditions, or £1 to avert one ton of CO2-eq emissions) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\nWe see potential benefit from WWF UK’s work in a number of areas:\n- Preservation of nature as a goal in itself: While this initially seems persuasive, the beneficiary is not clear, and the goal might even be built on a naive appeal-to-nature fallacy. Preserving ecosystems or species may be better regarded as a means to an end, such as the following points around benefit to animals, climate change, and biodiversity. \n- Direct positive impact on animals: Some of WWF UK’s activities help animals directly, such as their efforts to keep the river Mara flowing. However, the ethics of wild animal welfare are complex, and so is the interconnectedness of life. Therefore, it is not straightforward to determine which individual animals benefit from certain kinds of protection, especially if we include smaller animals and not just emblematic species such as pandas and snow leopards.\n- Avoiding climate change: The effects of unmitigated climate change have been studied widely and climate action is recognised as beneficial for humans and animals. WWF’s impact on climate action stems mainly from raising public and corporate awareness through campaigns such as Our Planet. However, their direct spending on climate change and the polar regions amounts to only 3% of their budget.\n- Avoiding adverse effects of biodiversity loss: Rather than preservation of nature as such, we can analyse the negative impact of biodiversity loss and derive an assessment of the positive impact of WWF’s activities. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) asserts in their [Global Assessment Report Summary](https://ipbes.net/sites/default/files/2020-02/ipbes_global_assessment_report_summary_for_policymakers_en.pdf) that biodiversity loss \"poses a serious risk to global food security\" (p. 12) and \"Nature is essential for achieving the [UN] Sustainable Development Goals\" (p. 15). Biodiversity can be a source of medicines, whereas deterioration of nature has negative impacts on health (p. 22). It seems that WWF’s activities such as their campaigning for the protection of habitats and species and fight against causes of deforestation could have a substantial impact to counter negative effects of biodiversity loss, such as crop productivity risks due to soil degradation and pollinator loss (p. 11). However, quantifying this impact is very difficult given the complex interactions both in our political and social systems (for campaigning work) and in nature and its ecosystems (for direct conservation work).\n\nHowever, it is unclear what impact can be attributed to WWF UK on achieving the above areas. The charity does not provide a detailed impact analysis in their reports. They do analyse certain campaigns such as their [impact report](https://www.wwf.org.uk/sites/default/files/2020-09/wwfuk_our%20planet%20impact%20report_final.pdf) on the Our Planet Netflix series. However, this mainly focuses on immediate impact like views and digital engagements.\n\nOne further complicating factor is the international nature of WWF’s work. As shown in the example of the protection of the Tuvaijuittuq marine protection area, it is unclear what expenditure and contribution can be attributed to WWF UK rather than other partners involved in the international network.\n\nFinally, much of the charity’s work is based on public campaigning and raising awareness. Here, it can be asked how much this is driving direct impacts, especially since some concerns like climate change are already widely recognised.\n\nIn summary, we feel that WWF UK plausibly does valuable work, especially regarding the preservation of biodiversity with its associated benefits as established by the IPBES, including indirect positive effects for the climate. However, in order to assess the value of this work we would need more information, in particular:\n- the cost of specific interventions\n- WWF UK’s theory of change and perceived benefits of specific interventions\n- the extent to which WWF UK’s work relates to other initiatives from other (conservation) organisations, and the extent to which WWF UK took a leading role in specific campaigns and interventions\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate WWF UK as More Information Needed under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective\n- We have no indication of cost-effectiveness, or we do not judge those indications to be promising\n",
