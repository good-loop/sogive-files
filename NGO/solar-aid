      "adjustmentComment": "Solar aid exited from two countries (Kenya and Tanzania) within the most recent financial year (2015-16). There were costs to this exit, which are reflected within the figures we use. SoGive judged that it would be overly pessimistic to calculate the cost per solar lamp based solely on the 2015-16 financial year, since this would essentially bake in an assumption that further exit costs will be incurred next year too, which we don\u0027t know to be true. However, under our understanding of Solar Aid\u0027s philosophy, they are happy for solar lamps to be adopted within a country, and they don\u0027t mind if this is via the success of local providers or whether it\u0027s Solar Aid\u0027s own company (Sunny Money) which takes lion\u0027s share of the market. Therefore we are calculating the cost per solar lamp based on the last 2 years: Apr 2014 - Mar 2016. This implicitly bakes in some chance that more costs may be incurred for leaving other countries.",
