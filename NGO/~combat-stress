  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**Combat Stress  is rated as More Information Needed on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- Combat Stress offers therapeutic and clinical, community and residential treatment to former members of the British Armed Forces who are suffering from a range of mental health conditions; including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n- In 2021, Combat Stress spent £12.9 million, of which their spending on charitable activities was split into: 90% on clinical services; 4% on their helpline; and 6% on raising awareness and improving access.\n- Combat Stress reported that they supported 4,900 veterans through their provision of clinical services in 2021, however because we have assumed their clinical services expenditure also includes all their research costs we have not been able to determine a cost per beneficiary.\n- We are therefore unable to compare them to our Gold Standard, and so we have rated them as More Information Needed.\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what Combat Stress does - how they spend your donations**\n\nCombat Stress is the UK’s largest charity helping veterans’ with mental health problems, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression. In their [2021 annual report](https://combatstress.org.uk/file/12855/download?token\u003d-aygqaHF), they state that they helped almost 14,000 veterans: 8,900 veterans called their helpline; 3,600 accessed their new online self-help resources; and 1,300 veterans received direct support from their specialist staff. In 2021, they spent 90% of their charitable activities expenditure on clinical services (giving £9.4 million of non-project adjusted costs). We omitted an impairment charge of £2.3 million from the total, as this is a one off expenditure due to the revaluation of property before it is sold and doesn’t give an accurate reflection of future cost-effectiveness . They provided treatment and support to veterans which included: 1:1 assessments; support and therapy sessions by phone and online; creating a range of online self-help resources; access to an online peer support community; and running a family support pilot programme. They only provide treatment that is evidence based and their in house research team evaluates their treatment programmes. The research team in 2021 published over 20 academic papers in peer reviewed scientific journals. In their [Research Strategy](https://combatstress.org.uk/file/8791/download?token\u003d-VEq1I3J) they detailed that their three research aims from 2014-19 were: Evaluating Combat Stress treatment programmes; Population research - Understanding the needs of help-seeking veterans; and Exploring new ways to support help seeking veterans. In 2021, 8,900 veterans called the free 24 hour helpline. This is the first contact veterans will have with the charity and they are either given specialist treatment through Combat Stress’ services or directed to other mental health services such as the NHS or other third sector services. In 2021, Combat Stress spent 4% of their charitable activities expenditure on their helpline (giving £380,000 of non-project adjusted costs) providing their helpline service. Combat Stress are also trying to increase the awareness and improve the accessibility of the charity and in 2021 spent 6% of their charitable activities expenditure (giving £614,000 of non-project adjusted costs) within this area. Their annual report states: ‘This represents the direct costs of publicising and promoting our services directly to veterans, their families and medical health professionals.’\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Combat Stress compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of Combat Stress’ work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold rating, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nWhen evaluating Combat Stress’ cost effectiveness, their expenditure on their clinical services gives us the best representation of their overall work (because the helpline is just a first contact service for veterans). In the financial year of 2021, due to the Covid -19 pandemic most of their services were offered remotely and constituted of providing 1:1 assessments, support and therapy sessions by phone and online, the creation of a range of online self-help resources, access to an online peer support community and running a family support pilot service. In 2021, Combat Stress spent £9.4 million (non-project adjusted costs) and provided direct support to 1,300 veterans as well as 3,600 veterans accessing their new online self help resources. This initially provides us with a number of 4,900 veterans supported at a cost of £9.4 million (non-project adjusted costs) which equates to just under £2,000 per veteran supported. However, as the research spending total is not separately detailed in Combat Stress’ annual reports we can assume that this total also includes research, therefore skewing this cost per veteran as Combat Stress published over 20 academic papers during this period. Combat Stress’ research department works closely with the King’s Centre for Military Health Research at King’s College London, along with various other academic institutions, to conduct research with direct relevance to Combat Stress beneficiaries. Their website states: ‘We are committed to publishing our research as part of our commitment to contribute to the advancement of the veteran mental health field.’ If their research does influence other mental health treatments, this has a wider impact than just charity beneficiaries, although we have not seen evidence of this. This research also informs treatment for future programmes, not just those within the financial year it was conducted. For more information on how we would conduct cost-effectiveness analysis of their research work if they provided more data on research expenditure and outputs under our 3 question method please click [here.](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-three-question-method-for.html?q\u003dresearch\u0026view\u003dsidebar)\n\nCombat Stress claim that all their treatments are evidence based and they conduct their own research into their interventions. In 2020, they published a study entitled [‘An RCT of The Together Webinar Programme (TTP-webinar): Increasing the Accessibility of Mental Health Support for Military Partners’](https://combatstress.org.uk/file/8794/download?token\u003dgpo2ZCkn) in which they assessed the impact of their webinar programme, using a randomised control trial with [GHQ-12](https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article/57/1/79/1557723) and [STSS](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254364576_The_Secondary_Traumatic_Stress_Scale_STSS) self-administered questionnaires which are designed to measure outcomes related to mental health disorders and secondary trauma, respectively. The results were analysed using chi-squared and independent t-tests. While we haven’t conducted an in-depth analysis of this research, the methodology, outcome measuring and data analysis suggest that Combat Stress do use a good protocol for ensuring their treatments are evidence based, which is evidence we’d need to determine the cost-effectiveness of their work. Their annual report states that their research department will continue to partner with King’s Centre for Military Health Research at King’s College London to evaluate treatment programmes as well as undertake follow up studies to look at unique trauma experiences of female veterans and of UK BAME veterans. This suggests that their newer treatments, including online resources, introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic will be subject to further RCT’s.\n\nAs mentioned above, as the total provided for Combat Stress’ clinical services includes research and a further breakdown of costs aren’t provided, it makes it difficult for us to compare Combat Stress to our benchmarks. We would need them to provide this information to enable us to calculate their cost-effectiveness. It is also worth noting that the expenditure on Clinical Services in 2021 was reduced due to a cut back on face to face services (a decrease of around £1 million compared to 2020). Combat Stress in their annual report, state that they plan to significantly increase their online treatment provision and their online group clinical treatments. If the outcomes are similar for both face to face and online treatments (initial in-house research is promising), and more beneficiaries can be offered treatment online, for a lower cost, this has the potential to increase Combat Stress’ cost-effectiveness.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze ratings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Combat Stress as More Information Needed under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective\n- We have no indication of cost-effectiveness, or we do not judge those indications to be promising\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I learnt techniques to manage my mental health problems in the long-term and as a result I take better care of myself. I also think the ITP made me feel more comfortable in speaking about my experiences, and in turn I’ve been able to express myself better at my local Peer Support meetings.\n\n\"I was planning on going back to the Army, but after the ITP I realised I wanted to focus on just living my life without having too much on my plate. So I decided to leave.\"\n\nNow Rebecca says she feels stronger than ever and enjoys helping other veterans as a Peer Support volunteer, which she does alongside her job as a social sciences lecturer.",
