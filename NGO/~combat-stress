  "recommendation": "**Combat Stress achieves a bronze assessment under the SoGive rating methodology.**\n\nCombat Stress is a UK charity in the United Kingdom offering therapeutic and clinical treatment to UK veterans suffering from mental health issues. The charity activities include clinical and community services, a helpline, raising awareness and improving access, and substance misuse case management service.\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-sogive-approach-to-assessing.html),  we consider two questions:\n- how much does it cost for the charity to do something\n- what is the thing (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)\n\n\n**More about what Combat Stress does**\n\n\n\n\n**Benchmarking**\n\nSoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold-standard for charity effectiveness. To receive a Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as being able to save a life for £3000) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work.\nBased on the annual report, we understand that it costs _ £_ to… For this reason, it is likely that a donation to _ will achieve less positive impact than the same amount of money given to a Gold-rated organization.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n",

  "stories": "Rebecca started having one-to-one sessions with a member of the community mental health team before she completed the six-week PTSD Intensive Treatment Programme (ITP) at Hollybush House.\n\n\"I’m so glad I did the ITP because I’ve got a lot out of it. I learnt techniques to manage my mental health problems in the long-term and as a result I take better care of myself. I also think the ITP made me feel more comfortable in speaking about my experiences, and in turn I’ve been able to express myself better at my local Peer Support meetings.\n\n\"I was planning on going back to the Army, but after the ITP I realised I wanted to focus on just living my life without having too much on my plate. So I decided to leave.\"\n\nNow Rebecca says she feels stronger than ever and enjoys helping other veterans as a Peer Support volunteer, which she does alongside her job as a social sciences lecturer.",
