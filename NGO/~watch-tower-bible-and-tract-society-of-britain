  "recommendation": "**Watch Tower Bible \u0026 Tract Society Of Britain is rated as Too Rich on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\nWatch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Britain is a registered charity in the UK that aims to advance Christian religion as practiced by the Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide.\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-sogive-approach-to-assessing.html), we consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)\n\n\n**More about what Watch Tower Bible \u0026 Tract Society Of Britain does**\n\nWatch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Britain (WBTS) is an organisation whose objective is to advance the Christian religion as practiced by the Jehovah’s Witnesses (JW). This is done through activities such as promoting preaching by Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide, producing and distributing bibles, promoting religious worship and missionary work, and advancing religious education.\n\nWBTS’ operation appears to be integrated closely with the work of JW worldwide. At the time of this analysis, we could not identify any website with specific information about WBTS or JW’s organisation in the UK. This analysis is based on WBTS’ statutory annual report (AR) published by the [Charity Commission](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/charity-details/3966490/accounts-and-annual-returns), as well as information from the international [JW web site](https://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/).\n\nIn the reporting period 2019/20 ending on 31 August, WBTS spent a total of £99.6m on donor-funded charitable activities (AR p. 12). The major activities were as follows (AR p. 1):\n\nSupporting worldwide JW entities to promote religious activity overseas, including through construction of places of worship and disaster relief, primarily in developing countries. This amounts to 83% of spending or £83m. \n\nRedevelopment of places of worship, in this case Kingdom Halls owned by local JW congregations and the new UK headquarter of JW in Essex. This amounts to 16% of spending.\nProvisions of facilities to assist full-time ministers (1%).\n\nThe annual report mentions the promotion of well-being, respect, honesty and kindness as public benefits, as well as the creation of attractive and dignified buildings (p. 1). No details are reported regarding the impact of the bulk of spending in donations to worldwide sister organisations, other than the mention of new places of worship and disaster relief efforts in general. Regarding WBTS’ impact it should be noted that JW has been [criticised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Jehovah%27s_Witnesses) for authoritarianism and denial of free spech leadership, rejection of blood transfusions, and controversial handling of sexual abuse cases.\n\nAs an example of disaster relief in the year 2020, the [JW worldwide website](https://www.jw.org/en/library/series/how-your-donations-are-used/Providing-Relief-to-Victims-of-Disasters/) reports that 50,000 people in Angola and 22,700 people in Zimbabwe have been provided with food relief, regardless of their faith. However, it remains unclear if there is any relation to donations from the WBTS. Also, the amount of spending on disaster relief versus other activities like promoting preaching or distributing bibles cannot be discerned from the charity’s report.\n\nThe majority of WBTS’ funding (92%) stems from donations and legacies (AR p. 12). There is no cost on fundraising activity and JW [claims](https://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/faq/donations-worldwide-work-finances-money/)  that their primary source of financing worldwide is voluntary donations from individuals who are Jehovah’s Witnesses.\n\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis**\n\nWe have not been able to gather enough information to perform a cost-effectiveness assessment for WBTS, since they have not published any material impact assessments.\n\nIn particular, having reviewed information about this charity, we are unclear about the scale of their work, i.e. how many people have been reached by them. We are also unclear about the average impact per person.\n\nOur assessment is largely based on the amount of reserves that the charity has, which suggests to us that the charity is unlikely to be able to usefully utilise further funds.\n\nAs of August 2020, WBTS had around £193m in reserves. They spent around £99 million in that period. This means that if, surprisingly, every single donation dried up overnight, they would still have enough funds left to keep them going for almost 2 years. This is a high level of reserves compared to charity sector norms, and is typically a result of a combination of a charity having a strong following of committed donors and also not enough valuable projects that are consistent with their charitable objectives.\n\nNote that if the charity had plans to spend some of the £193 million, then they should account for those funds differently; i.e. they should be treated as funds \"designated\" for a specific purpose.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Watch Tower Bible \u0026 Tract Society Of Britain as Too Rich under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We believe that the charity already has lots of money, so a donation will likely have minimal impact for some time\n- A charity which we deem too rich will likely have enough money that even if all other funding sources dried up, they could fund their full activities for another 18 months, and there are no mitigating factors, such as planned activities, their own reserves policy, and our judgement about the risks they are exposed to\n",
