  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**The British Heart Foundation is tentatively rated as Not Recommended on the SoGive ratings scale**\n\n- The British Heart Foundation primarily funds research and innovation into cardiovascular diseases (CVD)\n- Based on estimates of the charity’s contribution to global CVD research, and trends in the global burden of cardiovascular disease over recent decades, we estimate that for every £1,700 donated to the BHF, it will prevent loss of the equivalent of one year of full health (i.e. it will avert one disability-adjusted life year, DALY)\n- In order to meet SoGive’s Gold Standard, charities have to achieve an outcome equivalent to averting one DALY for £100-200\n- The BHF appears to fall well short of this, and is therefore tentatively rated as Not Recommended. The charity receives a tentative rather than firm Not Recommended rating because there is a large amount of uncertainty in our estimated cost-effectiveness, and it is based on an analysis of global trends rather than the charity’s specific projects. \n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what the British Heart Foundation does  - how they spend your donations**\n\nThe British Heart Foundation (BHF) is the UK’s single biggest funder of research into heart and circulatory diseases. Our analysis is based on the charity’s [2019/20 annual report](https://www.bhf.org.uk/-/media/files/what-we-do/com102-annual-report-final-reference.pdf?la\u003den\u0026rev\u003d452b4018047849059dc0e4c632b8c066\u0026hash\u003dD2419779BECC36FBE8AA685C3F5AC3902AB24250). This was before COVID-19, so we believe this annual report will likely be more representative of the charity’s longer-term activities and spending than the more recent report for 2020/21, where the charity reported a substantial drop in net income and spending on charitable activities due to the impact of the pandemic.\n\nIn 2019/20, the British Heart Foundation spent £93.1 million on research, while £34.5 million of their funds was spent on healthcare innovation (p. 98 of annual report).\nThe research areas they focus on are primary heart failure, arrhythmia, diabetes, heart attacks, and stroke. A sizable minority of BHF\u0027s work is on enabling a faster response to out-of-hospital heart attacks and cardiac arrests, such as providing CPR training in schools, community groups and workplaces, and making defibrillators more widely available. However, it is unclear how much the charity spent on each of these activities.\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis  - how does the British Heart Foundation compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of the BHF under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or preventing the loss of one year of full health for £100-£200) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nThe BHF’s 2019/20 annual report gives several examples of the specific research projects they have recently funded, and their website provides [many more examples](https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/our-research/research-successes). However, there is no indication of the overall impact of the research and innovation they have funded on changes in population health outcomes, nor are there any estimates of cost-effectiveness.\n\nGiven this, we have considered evidence around the wider impact of CVD research over recent decades and have attempted to estimate the BHF’s contribution to this and hence the charity’s cost-effectiveness. This is a version of the SoGive three-question method, described in more detail [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-three-question-method-for.html?view\u003dsidebar). There is a large amount of uncertainty around this approach, which is discussed in more detail below.\n\n*Estimating the BHF’s contribution to global CVD research*\n\nThe British Heart Foundation is responsible for [55% of noncommercial UK funding for CVD research](https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/news-from-the-bhf/news-archive/2021/march/budget-paints-disappointing-picture-for-charity-research-and-healthcare). In the United States in 2013 it was estimated that around 35% of all research and development funding is noncommercial ([see table 1 funding sources in this paper](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2015/nsf15330/nsf15330.pdf)). If this is also true for the UK, it would imply that the BHF is responsible for around 19.3% (55%*35%) of CVD research in the UK. We also estimate that around [17% of global CVD research is conducted in the UK](https://wellcome.org/sites/default/files/wtx052110_0.pdf) (p.20). This claim is from a 2008 study, but if still true today would imply the BHF is responsible for funding 3.27% (17%*19.3%) of all CVD research globally.\n\n*Change in the Global Burden of Cardiovascular Disease*\n\nThe global burden of a disease can be measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). \nOne DALY represents the loss of the equivalent of one year of full health; see [this WHO page](https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/158) for more details. \nAccording to the [Global Health Data Exchange](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool?params\u003dgbd-api-2019-permalink/614423145af41c7c083e797e5cac2cb6http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool), global age-standardized cardiovascular disease DALYs per 100,000 people have steadily decreased from around 7,085 in 1990 to 4,864 in 2019. A drop of 2,221 in 29 years means that, on average, 76.6 DALYs per 100,000 people were averted each year, which at our current world population of 7.9 billion means around 6.05m DALYs per year. \n\n*Change in the Global Burden of Cardiovascular Disease attributable to CVD research*\n\nWhile some of the decline in the burden of cardiovascular disease will be due to new treatments and preventative measures that derive from CVD research, some of the decline is due to independent changes in other factors, such as changes in behaviour and lifestyle. For example, in the year 2000 [more than 1 in 10 CVD deaths was attributable to smoking](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circulationaha.104.521708), and rates of smoking have been [falling in most countries in recent decades](https://ourworldindata.org/smoking#smoking-rates-are-falling-in-almost-all-countries). \n\nThere is a lot of uncertainty of the exact contribution of new treatments and therapies to the overall reduction in CVD burden. For example, in their [review of the literature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5268076/), Mensah et al write \"in the analysis by Ford et al. the best estimate of the reduction in CHD [coronary heart disease] deaths due to therapies was 47%, but could have been as low as 19% or as high as 94%. However, other recent studies using the same model seem to confirm that about half of the reduction in CHD deaths may indeed be due to medical or surgical treatments\". Based on this, we tentatively assume 50% of the global reduction in DALYs is attributable to CVD-specific research. \n\n*Estimating the BHF’s cost-effectiveness*\n\nThe above analysis suggests:\n- BHF is responsible for funding 3.27% of all CVD research globally\n- The global burden of CVD is declining by around 6,050,000 DALYs per year\n- 50% of the decline is attributable to CVD research\n\nMultiplying these values together, we therefore estimate that BHF is responsible for around 99,000 DALYs being averted each year. Given the charity’s annual spend on research, innovation, and fundraising of £167.6m, this implies a cost per DALY averted of around £1,700 per DALY.\n\nThere is a large amount of uncertainty around most of the values used. Plausible values for optimistic and pessimistic scenarios suggest that the BHF’s cost-effectiveness could be anywhere between around £300 to over £20,000 per DALY averted. These scenarios, and our central estimate of £1,700, are outlined [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M2TX6adrMPR8MkEkr6RbCJg-OeqrHjBoB2WdQAHyWOo/edit#gid\u003d0).\n\nThe central estimate suggests that for every £1,700 spent on CVD research by the BHF, it will prevent loss of the equivalent of one year of full health (i.e. it will avert one DALY). In order to meet SoGive’s Gold Standard, charities have to achieve an outcome equivalent to averting one DALY for around £100-200. Given this, it seems unlikely that a donation to the BHF will achieve an outcome as good as donating to a Gold rated charity.\n\n*Other considerations*\n\nSome of the values we have used are likely to be incorrect and/or out of date, and our calculations involve several assumptions. While some of this is reflected in the wide range of cost-effectiveness in the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, there are other factors that we have not incorporated into our estimates. In particular:\n- A [study by Bloom et al (2020)](https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf) published in the American Economic Review looks at research productivity across several industries and areas of biomedical research, including for heart disease. They conclude that research productivity - in terms of impact on years of life saved - has been declining for heart disease research in recent decades compared to previous decades. This implies the cost-effectiveness of funding CVD research is worse than we have estimated. By contrast, advances in AI could [potentially greatly improve biomedical research productivity](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-57929095).\n- Research funded now won’t have an impact for at least several years, if not decades. [Future benefits should be discounted to some extent](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40273-018-0672-z), but we have not done this for this piece of analysis. Doing so would slightly reduce the estimated cost-effectiveness.\n- We have not considered how reductions in the burden of CVD interact with overall changes in disease burden. For example, if someone doesn’t die from CVD, they may instead end up dying from cancer. This would potentially reduce the cost-effectiveness of funding CVD research (and indeed, cancer research, because the inverse could also be true).\n- In any given year, we would expect the most promising CVD research to be funded first. Therefore, we would expect any additional donations to be used for less cost-effective research than average.\n- On the other hand, the BHF could be funding research that is a lot more (or less) cost-effective than the average for CVD research. We remain open to evidence from the charity to show that this is the case.\n\nThis means there is still a considerable degree of uncertainty about the BHF’s true cost per DALY averted. A more in-depth analysis would explore these above factors, as well as other considerations such as the charity’s quality of management and commitment to evidence and cost-effectiveness.\nOverall, however, we think it is unlikely that the true cost per DALY averted is 10x less than our central estimate of £1,700 such that the BHF meets the Gold Standard.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we tentatively rate the British Heart Foundation as Not Recommended under the SoGive methodology. \n",
