  "description": "The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) engages in a wide variety of programs to try and expand sexual healthcare around the world, with a particular focus on developing countries. These programmes include, but are not limited to:\n- Providing access to contraception\n- Providing access to abortions\n- Maternal Healthcare\n- STI treatment\n- Counselling\n- Sex education\n- Campaigning for reproductive rights",
  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) is rated as More information needed (promising) on the SoGive ratings scale**\n- The IPPF’s activities focus upon improving reproductive health and promoting reproductive rights.\n- Some examples of their activities include: reproductive healthcare, such as abortions and STI treatment; contraception, such as condoms; sex and relationships education; and advocating for policy changes on reproductive issues.\n- Taking the figures from their 2020 annual report at face value, it appears IPPF provided 142.9 million sex and relationship health services and enabled 75.2 million more at an average cost of $0.60 per service provided/enabled. They also enabled the provision of sex education to 25.5 million young persons at an average cost of $0.15 per person. However the full costs of these services may well be higher, as IPPF does work with other organisations to provide some of their services.\n- Because this organisation has such low costs and is doing potentially life-saving work, it is plausible that IPPF could reach or exceed the SoGive Gold Standard.\n- However, as well as a better understanding of the full costs involved, we need more information about the outcomes of their programmes - such as their impacts on health and wellbeing - before we can ascertain whether their activities are good value for money.\n \n**The SoGive approach**\n \nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n \nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n \n**More about what the IPPF does - how they spend your donations**\n\nThe IPPF’s aim is to improve reproductive health and rights in 142 countries around the world. They attempt to do this by spending donations in three main ways: providing services to promote sex and reproductive health ($131.4 million), supporting sex education programmes ($3.8 million), and advocating for government policy changes ($10 million) (all figures are from the organisation’s [2020 annual report](https://www.ippf.org/sites/default/files/2021-06/IPPF%20Financial%20Statements%202020.pdf)).\nThis spending translated to the organisation providing or enabling 218.1 million sexual health services including, but not limited to: providing contraception, providing abortions, treating STIs, counselling, and pre-natal care. Meanwhile, their sex education programme contributed to 25.5 million young people receiving sex education via partnerships with education providers and providing teachers with training in sex education. Finally, they claim to have played a role in 136 policy changes via their support for local activists and lobbying activities. All figures of support provided come from page 10 of their [2020 annual report](https://www.ippf.org/sites/default/files/2021-06/IPPF%20Financial%20Statements%202020.pdf)\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does the IPPF compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n \nAfter a review of the work of the IPPF under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n \nIn 2020, the IPPF’s main area of work was providing or enabling 218.1 million sexual and reproductive health services at an estimated cost of $131.4 million. This implies an average cost of $0.60 per service, although the full cost of these services is likely higher as they partner with other organisations to provide some services. At such low costs per service, it is plausible that a health organisation like the IPPF has enough impact on physical and mental health to potentially reach SoGive’s Gold Standard. However, to be considered for a SoGive recommendation the IPPF would need to provide more information on the precise breakdown of the services provided, their costs, and robust estimates of their impact on health outcomes.\n\nTheir $3.8 million spend on helping 25.5 million young people receive sex education, at a cost of $0.15 per person, falls into a same category as their service provision. Owing to the low costs, it is possible this programme meets SoGive’s cost-effectiveness standards, but as the programme is run with partners we would need more information on its full costs - alongside evidence on its physical and mental health outcomes - to truly assess its cost-effectiveness.\n\nFinally, out of their $159.6 million budget they spent $10 million on campaigning in 2020. To assess this, we would make use of SoGive’s [three question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-three-question-method-for.html) for assessing campaigns if we were assessing the IPPF in greater detail. However, it should be noted as it’s a low portion of their budget it likely wouldn’t greatly affect our overall view of IPPF unless we had reason to believe this work was particularly strategic.\n\nGiven the low costs of the IPPF’s services alongside the fact much of their work is potentially life-saving (such as reducing deaths from STIs such as HIV, from difficult pregnancies/child birth, or from dangerous self-induced abortions), it is possible that the IPPF’s work achieves an impact that matches or exceeds SoGive’s Gold Standard.\n\nTo reach a firm assessment, the following information is required:\n- Robust evidence on the average effect of the IPPF’s programmes. This would require information on the exact breakdown of the IPPF’s activities across services and compelling evidence that their programmes improve health and wellbeing.\n- Furthermore, we would want to assess the quality of any evidence provided by the IPPF on the outcomes of their programmes to check if they are effective. This means reviewing whether a project has achieved the goals which the IPPF claims are relevant for that project, e.g. improved health outcomes, or protecting reproductive rights. We would then consider the methodology the IPPF used to evaluate the project and decide whether it is sufficiently robust to support any claims about the project’s true impact. This could involve establishing whether the project was implemented on the basis of previously obtained robust evidence and reasoning found in the wider literature, or the IPPF undertaking a high-quality assessment for themselves, such as a randomised controlled trial.\n- IPPF’s work, if effective, would likely have an impact on population growth in the countries it is active in. This would need to be incorporated into our models and this in turn depends on certain value judgments.\n- Clear information on how the IPPF works with partner and member organisations. This includes understanding exactly what services are provided alongside these organisations and the costs they incur in doing so. Knowing these costs is crucial to assessing the cost-effectiveness of their programmes.\n- Some indication of the IPPF’s strategy. This is because the information about cost-effectiveness discussed in this overview of the IPPF is based on their past activities. While this will often be a good indication of what a charity’s future activities will look like, sometimes a charity will change what they are focusing on, meaning that additional donations could be more or less cost-effective than the average past donation.\n- It would also be useful to consider whether the IPPF’s activities could be funded by service users rather than philanthropists. In some cases, it might be possible that providing these services at a cost would lead to a similar uptake of the health interventions.\n- A more complete analysis would also assess management capability. For example, this would involve assessing the IPPF’s capabilities around Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (or MEL) to ensure that they are learning from their mistakes (and not simply publishing evaluation reports that don’t change anything), and also understanding how the leadership sets strategy and selects projects; in particular, how the charity incorporates cost-effectiveness thinking into its strategic decisions. \n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate the International Planned Parenthood Federation as \"More information needed (promising)\" under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do have some indication of cost-effectiveness, and see the possibility that cost-effectiveness matches or exceeds the Gold Standard, but this depends on further data and analysis.\n",

An auto-reply came back saying that they would aim to reply within 2 weeks. On 7th March (i.e. a bit more than 2 weeks later) I chased. In May 2016 I sent them an email suggesting that they perhaps weren\u0027t interested in engaging with potential donors because they might already be too rich, and they still didn\u0027t reply.",
