  "description": "1% for the Planet is a global organisation that exists to ensure our planet and future generations thrive. We inspire businesses and individuals to support environmental nonprofits through membership and everyday actions. We make environmental giving easy and effective through partnership advising, impact storytelling and third-party certification.\n\nStarted in 2002 by Yvon Chouinard, founder of Patagonia, and Craig Mathews, founder of Blue Ribbon Flies, our business members and individual members have given hundreds of millions of dollars to our approved nonprofit partners to date. Today, 1% for the Planetâ€™s global network consists of thousands of businesses, individuals and environmental nonprofits working toward a better future for all. \n1% For The Planet was founded to prevent greenwashing, certify reputable giving and provide accountability. The 1% For The Planet certification is given to businesses and individuals that meet their high-bar commitment-donate 1% of annual sales or salary to environmental causes. ",
