  "description": "They provide grants to projects in the UK which focus on children and young people who are disadvantaged. They currently support 2,500 local charities and projects across the UK. The projects they fund help children facing a range of disadvantages, for example, poverty and deprivation; children who have been the victims of abuse or neglect or disabled young people.\n\nBBC Children in Need currently awards grants at six points during the year and funds two types of grants. The Main Grants Programme is for grants over £10,000 per year to support projects for up to three years. Meanwhile, the Small Grants Programme supports projects for up to three years, and includes grants up to and including £10,000 per year.",
  "recommendation": "**BBC Children in Need is rated as Not Recommended (tentative) on the SoGive ratings scale**\n\nBBC Children in Need supports children and young people across the UK who are affected by the disadvantages they experience, such as living in poverty, being disabled, marginalised, or experiencing abuse, trauma or loss.\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-sogive-approach-to-assessing.html), we consider two questions:\n- how much does it cost for the charity to do something\n- what benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)\n\n\n**More about what BBC Children in Need does**\n\nBBC Children in Need predominantly acts as a fundraising organisation and makes grants to other charitable organisations across the UK. Their [2020 annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA10739311\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d802052) (covering the year to June 2020), indicates a total expenditure, including admin and fundraising, of £58.89m (p.62 of annual report). This supported around 2500 projects and services (p.10) which they claim has helped change the lives of around 550,000 children and young people (p.6). \n\nThe annual report indicates how expenditure is distributed across the UK, with 65% supporting projects and services in England, 8.5% in Scotland, 5.3% in Wales, 4.7% in Northern Ireland, and 16.5% being UK-wide grants. The estimated number of children helped in these countries is 434,000 (England), 61,000 (Scotland), 20,000 (Wales), and 35,000 (Northern Ireland)(p.16).\n\nGiven the large number of projects and services, it is unsurprising that details about each one are not provided in the annual report. This means we do not know how many children were helped by each project or how much each project cost, other than the fact that the size of grants ranged from a few thousand pounds to over £100,000 (p.18). We do note that specific projects are included on [this website](https://www.bbcchildreninneed.co.uk/grants/), and this includes the costs of the project, but not the number of children helped or the extent to which they benefitted.\n\nThe report does indicate the number of children helped in different categories (p.16). The biggest category is poverty and deprivation, where around 202,000 children were helped. Other categories include disability (92,000 children helped), illness (66,000), distress (60,000), marginalised groups (59,000), abuse/neglect (33,000), and behavioural difficulties (15,000). However, the amount spent on each category is not indicated in the annual report.\n\nSome examples of projects funded include:\n- Wave, Prescription Surf - a model of social prescribing for children with the support of commissioners and GP practices in Cornwall\n- Stormbreak - a programme of curated and creative movement to support the mental health of children\n- Parent Zone - a digital project offering expert advice and encouraging communication between parents and children about their mental health\n- Supporting the Mayor’s Fund for London’s Kitchen Social initiative, which seeks to tackle food insecurity outside of term time\n- NSPCC’s Childline service to enable them to reach more children and young people\n\nWhile 84% of their grants go to support organisations that apply for funding, BBC Children in Need do appear to make direct grants to some families via their Emergency Essentials funds (p.21). These are \"small grants of (on average) £255, made available relatively quickly at a local level that can arrest the negative impact of severe poverty, a lack of the basic facilities which most of us take for granted and additional pressures such as domestic violence, disability or poor health in the family\". This supported around 28,000 children at a total cost of around £3m.\n\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis**\n\nAfter a review of the work of BBC Children in Need under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold-standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £50 to double someone’s consumption (spending) for one year, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work.\n\nBased on the total expenditure of £58.89m and total number of children helped of 550,000, this implies an average cost of around £107 per child helped. However, we expect the true costs of helping these children is higher. This is because many of the projects are collaborations with other organisations who may be using additional sources of funds (other than those provided by Children in Need) to support the projects.\n\nDue to the lack of information about specific projects we cannot estimate their cost-effectiveness. However, given the wide range of projects funded, we expect that the average impact will be below that of the SoGive Gold Standard. Thus, even if Children in Need happen to be funding some very cost-effective projects, they are also likely to be funding some that are closer to (or below) the average.\n\nThe largest number of children - around 202,000 -  were helped in the poverty and deprivation category. In the absence of further information we will assume that the cost per child helped in this category is around the average of £107. This is consistent with the Emergency Essentials funds, where £3m was spent supporting around 28,000 children. This funding may well have a positive impact on the wellbeing of these children, and contribute to a lower level of poverty. \n\nHowever, to match or exceed the SoGive Gold Standard, this funding would have to improve their well-being to an extent that was equivalent to averting over 6 months of severe depression, or otherwise double their consumption (spending) for over two years. Because this seems implausible, we doubt BBC Children in Need are likely to come close to the Gold Standard. However, we are somewhat uncertain about this and remain open to new evidence to the contrary.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate BBC Children in Need as Not Recommended (tentative) under the SoGive methodology. \n",
