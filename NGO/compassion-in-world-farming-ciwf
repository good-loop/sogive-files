  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**Compassion in World Farming is rated as More Information Needed (tentatively promising) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- Compassion in World Farming (CIWF) campaigns for improved welfare for farm animals by engaging with supranational bodies, national governments, corporates and the public.\n- In the 2019/20 financial year, CIWF spent a total of about £11.3m on donor-funded charitable activities in three areas with roughly similar levels of spending: public awareness and diet change, European legislation, and food business programs targeting voluntary welfare pledges and transparency for consumers.\n- Within these three areas, the outcomes of the food business programs can be quantified best. CIWF claims to have benefited 190 million animals within the reporting period through their activities in this area. \n- If we assume that 20% of these benefits are directly due to CIWF, this leads to costs of around just 9p per animal affected. This implies potentially very high cost-effectiveness. Most of the quantified benefits relate to chickens, but promising initiatives also target fish. However, it is difficult to directly relate this cost per animal to the Gold Standard benchmark of fully averting the suffering of one chicken living in very poor conditions.\n- On balance, we still feel that CIWF’s activities are promising and likely cost-effective for promoting animal welfare. However, significant uncertainties remain around the specific benefits and cost-effectiveness of these activities.\n\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n\n**More about what Compassion in World Farming does - how they spend your donations**\n\nCompassion in World Farming International (CIWF) is a global network of charities founded in the UK In 1967. CIWF is campaigning and lobbying for a world where factory farming has ended and all farm animals are treated with compassion and respect. \n\nIn the 2019/20 financial year, CIWF spent a total of about £11.3m on donor-funded charitable activities, according to their UK [annual report](https://www.ciwf.org.uk/media/7442890/ciwf_annual-report-and-accounts-2020.pdf) (AR). They also publish a separate financial report for their US operations. However, they provide an aligned [impact report](https://action.ciwf.org/media/7443081/ciwf_impact-report-2020-singles.pdf) that shows that the main funding is provided by the UK charity.\n\nThe charity funds activities in three strategic areas: Awareness of the harm of factory farming and corresponding diet change, European legislation to benefit farm animals, and food industry commitments for animal welfare.\n\n*Awareness and diet change*\n\nThis first area received 30% of CIWF’s charitable expenditure in the reporting period. CIWF calls this area \"Averting Farmageddon\", referring to a book title by their CEO Philip Lymbery. Under this heading, the organisation performs a wide range of lobbying and campaigning activities, targeting the public, governments, international organisations like the UN Environment Agency, and food companies.\n\nFor example, CIWF organised or co-hosted events like the World Conference of Farm Animal Welfare, funded and presented new books, reports and articles, engaged with politicians and animal welfare experts in the UK, in Europe, and in various UN bodies. CIWF collaborates with other NGOs that support animal welfare. Their communications team claims that their coverage had a potential reach of almost 8 billion views in the financial year 2019-20.\n\n*European legislation*\n\n40% of CIWF’s expenditure is spent on campaigning and advocacy for improved animal welfare law in Europe. Specifically, they promote cage-free farming for various animals like pigs and rabbits, the introduction of welfare standards for fish, food product welfare labelling, a ban on long distance animal transport, and better control of antibiotics use in farming.\n\nDuring the 2019-20 financial year, a coalition of 170 organisations including CIWF secured over 1 million signatures for the \"End the Cage Age\" European Citizens’ Initiative. CIWF lobbies EU bodies and national governments in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia among others, and provides information based on undercover investigations and research. In 2019, a welfare label was introduced in collaboration with Casino in France. However, the label was criticised by Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) in their [review](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/compassion-in-world-farming/) because the lowest level of welfare is called \"standard\".\n\n*Food business*\n\nImproving welfare standards through transparency and voluntary commitments from food companies in the global food supply chain is the third area of activities, which receives 30% of funds. \n\nCIWF claims that the activities in this area benefit a total of 190m animals, mainly chickens. Most of this impact is generated by direct pledges from food companies like Intermarché, Carrefour, or KFC. The charity also improves transparency through the Good Farm Animal Welfare Awards, the EggTrack commitment reporting scheme, and the publication of a Business Benchmark on Farm Animal Welfare that covers 150 food companies.\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Compassion in World Farming compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nTo review the work of Compassion in World Farming under the two-question method, we analyse costs per output and compare this to SoGive’s Gold-standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5 to avert the suffering of one chicken who is living in very poor conditions) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work.\n\nIn our analysis, we draw upon the analysis performed by Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) in their [comprehensive review](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/compassion-in-world-farming/) of CIWF International. This includes a detailed quantitative study of the outcomes of CIWF and comparable animal welfare charities for a 15-month period from April 2018 to June 2019.\n\nCIWF’s activities on the first two areas of ‘awareness and diet change’ and ‘legislation’ show the potential to achieve significant and lasting improvements for animals. However, it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of these measures. This is mainly because it is hard to assess the causal relationship between the activities of the charity and any animal legislation that is eventually passed. ACE acknowledges this difficulty, but assesses CIWF’s legislative work as \"likely to be impactful\", but its cost-effectiveness as \"below the average of [some] other charities\" reviewed by ACE in 2019.\n\nIn the area of food business, we can derive some actual estimates for cost-effectiveness.  CIWF reports that they have benefited 190m animals in the financial year 2019/20 through their activities (AR, p. 22). However, food company commitments are achieved through joint action with other organisations, so only part of these benefits are fully due to CIWF. We roughly estimate this ratio to be 20%, based on the lower end of ACE’s analysis. This means 38m animals benefited through an attributable expenditure of £3.4m by CIWF in the area of food business. This is 9p per chicken for one year. This estimate is in line with a range of between 5p and 17p per chicken per year benefited in ACE’s report.\n\nThis cost is significantly below the Gold Standard benchmark of £5 to avert the suffering of one chicken who is living in very poor conditions, implying potentially very high cost-effectiveness. However, there are a number of uncertainties or qualifications that would need to be addressed:\n- The degree of benefit of CIWF’s corporate outreach work needs to be assessed in relation to the benchmark. Regarding food company pledges, for example, it is not even generally accepted that cage-free environments are better for hen welfare. In 2017, Open Philanthropy published a [report](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/farm-animal-welfare/how-will-hen-welfare-be-impacted-transition-cage-free-housing) on the impact of cage-free environments, where they admit uncertainty, but still conclude that \"the U.S. transition to cage-free housing systems will on net reduce hen suffering once mortality rates have stabilized\". Even if there are benefits, they might be smaller than fully averting suffering as referred to in the Gold Standard. However, based on the current estimate of 9p per chicken, the benefit could be (£5 / £0.09p) 55 times smaller and still meet the Gold Standard.\n- A high uncertainty remains in the cost effectiveness of CIWF’s awareness and diet change work. Diet change is often assessed based on unreliable self-reported data.\n- We are not aware of any quantitative studies on the impact of animal welfare advocacy for better legislation.\n- Corporate outreach programmes that aim for voluntary welfare pledges have been studied by ACE in 2014, but these reports have been archived after criticism in 2017-18. We would like to see new studies on corporate outreach interventions to be able to judge the effects of these activities.\n- Incremental improvements in the living conditions for farmed animals seem to be a laudable outcome of animal advocacy groups. However, it can be argued that these improvements actually make society more comfortable with meat eating and hinder the achievement of more fundamental goals such as animal rights. There are also arguments that voluntary pledges lead to harmful \"co-optation\" between animal rights groups and food companies. \n\nACE views reducing the suffering of farmed animals as a high-impact cause area. They believe that \"targeting influential groups with substantial decision-making power is likely to be cost effective\" and think that CIWF’s latest campaigns around farmed fish welfare \"may be particularly impactful programs\". While ACE views the outcomes of CIWF’s corporate outreach programmes as \"below average relative to other charities\", for example The Humane League, the estimates and assessments on which this assessment is based are far from certain. And even with the current estimates from ACE, and assuming the other activities for awareness and diet change as well as food business campaigns are net neutral, the cost effectiveness would still be around 30p per animal reached.\n\nOn balance, we feel that CIWF’s activities are promising and likely cost-effective for promoting animal welfare. More information regarding the points outlined above would enable us to better judge the overall effectiveness of CIWF.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Compassion in World Farming as More Information Needed (tentatively promising) under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective\n- For a tentative rating, we may have no explicit charity-specific indicator of cost-effectiveness, or may have partial cost-effectiveness indicators\nWe may employ analytical judgement to determine what seems promising\n",
