  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**St. George’s Hospital Charity is rated as More Information Needed on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- St. George’s Hospital Charity supports the work of St. George’s Hospital by providing health-related grants for the London community, improving the patient and family experience, purchasing medical equipment, supporting research and more.\n- The Hospital Charity’s annual reports do not break down their programs adequately enough to judge how cost-effective their activities are.\n- Therefore, more information needs to be provided for the charity to be compared to our Gold Standard charities.\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what St. George’s Hospital Charity does - how they spend your donations**\n\nSt. George’s Hospital Charity aims to improve the experience of patients, staff, families and the local community served by St. George’s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, a London-based hospital. A great variety of activities are performed by the charity towards these ends, including spending on arts, improving hospital structures and infrastructure, the community, medical equipment, patient and family experience, research, and staff development and welfare. Total expenditure by the charity totalled £4.2m. In general, the charity only reported how much was spent or purchased and not what outcomes were achieved with that spending. In addition, although spending is broken down into the categories above and examples of projects within those categories are provided, how money is spent within each category is not comprehensively accounted for. We need this information in order to determine how a typical donation would be spent.\n\nThe greatest expenditure of the charity in 2021 was on community grants, accounting for £943,000 or 26% of the charity\u0027s charitable spending. Within this category are programs that are partially funded by the charity in London boroughs, such as a project in Sutton supporting people with poor mental health and at risk of alcohol-related hospital admissions, and a project in Merton that co-produces educational material to improve maternal and newborn health outcomes and materials for those who are living with or at risk of diabetes. These types of programs account for £750,000 of community spending in the 2021 annual report. In addition to these borough-specific programs, the report highlighted a £50,000 grant to reduce health inequalities in minority ethnic communities with the expansion of a project in Wandsworth and Merton to improve health outcomes for those at risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension through a partnership with local faith leaders and members of minority ethnic communities. \n\nThe second greatest expenditure of the charity was on patient and family experience, accounting for 17% or £568,000 of the charity’s charitable expenditure. A comprehensive breakdown of activities by spending is not provided, however some of the many activities highlighted in the 2021 annual report included providing patients 150 iPads so that they could speak to loved ones virtually, providing beds for partners in maternity wards, redesigning the Children’s Garden, a play area for children patients, and funding the construction of Wudu Wash facilities for Muslim patients in the hospital in addition to many other activities. \n\nThe third largest expenditure is the purchasing of medical equipment. Medical equipment grants make up 16% or £567,000 of the charity’s 2021 charitable expenditure. Some purchases funded by the charity that year include equipment for surgery on unborn babies with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, a new central monitoring unit for the hospital’s maternity ward, and, in partnership with two other charities, retinal imaging equipment for use with babies.\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does St. George’s Hospital Charity compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of St. George’s Hospital Charity’s work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold rating, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as saving a life for £5,000) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nIn 2020, St. George’s Hospital Charity stated that their work benefitted 50,000 people in the prior year. Using the report published that year, the charity spent a total of £2,993,000. This means that the charity spent £59.86 per beneficiary on average. In order for this charity to be gold-rated using SoGive’s benchmarks, these benefits should provide at least as much improvement to well-being as doubling someone’s income for one year. However, due to the charity not providing a comprehensive breakdown of how money is being spent within each of their project areas, how many benefit from that spending, and how substantial those benefits are, there is not enough information provided to give a specific rating to the charity.\n\nTo assign a more specific rating to St. George’s Hospital Charity, we would need a comprehensive breakdown of spending within each of their project areas, the number of beneficiaries for a significant amount of those activities, how much responsibility the charity has over activities which are performed in partnership with organisations, and evidence of how much those beneficiaries benefit. \n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze ratings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate St. George’s Hospital Charity as More Information Needed under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective.\n- We have no indication of cost-effectiveness, or we do not judge those indications to be promising.",
