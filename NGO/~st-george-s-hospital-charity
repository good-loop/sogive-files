  "recommendation": "**To assign a firm rating to St George’s Hospital Charity under the SoGive rating methodology, we would need more information. Our tentative rating for the charity is Bronze**\n\nSt George’s Hospital Charity aims to support the work of St George’s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-sogive-approach-to-assessing.html),  we consider two questions:\n- how much does it cost for the charity to do something\n- what is the thing (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor’s money)\n\n**More about what St George’s Hospital Charity does**\n\nWe could not gather enough information from the annual report to perform a detailed analysis or form opinions about their work under the SoGive methodology.\n\nSt George’s Hospital Charity provides a lot of information regarding the budget used to deliver their projects, but the overall cost-effectiveness analysis of their work cannot be performed. This is partly because in their annual report the charity lists several projects and the funds they used to pursue them, but many of these projects include very different activities, each of which can have a different level of impactfulness.\n\nFor example, in their project aiming to improve patient and family experience, St George’s Hospital Charity spent £359,000, or 15% of charitable funds. This budget was used to purchase sofa beds, flower displays, devices that make injections less scary for children, and electronic guides for patients and staff. This money was also used to organise events to provide various services patients such as bedside music, temporary exhibition programmes, and dance classes for individuals with Parkinson’s Disease.\n\nDifferent activities such as organising events and making injections for children less scary can have very different impacts, so the cost-effectiveness assessment of the marginal pound donated to the project cannot be delivered. Even if we had a cost breakdown, we do not have quantitative data about the number of people who would be helped in each initiative and the extent to which each individual is helped.\n\nSimilarly, St George’s Hospital Charity reports spending £619,000, or 31% of charitable funds on medical equipment. From the report we understand that at least 5 important pieces of equipment were purchased from this budget, such as a cardiovascular monitoring device and a MEP machine, which monitors impact on the spinal cord during surgery. However, St George’s Hospital Charity provides neither a cost breakdown nor an impact assessment of these purchases. For us to be able to assess the cost-effectiveness of this project, we would need to know how many people will benefit from the equipment and the degree of such benefit.\n\nThe charity spent 19% of charitable expenses on staff development and welfare. This project involved training programs and welfare programs like theatre visits. In addition to a cost-breakdown, we want to know the number of staff reached and to what extent these programs allow the staff to do a better job.\n\nThe charity also directed 6% of charitable funds towards capital projects and infrastructure. These funds will be used to build a new ward, a new waiting room, and an emergency and major trauma research facility. Again, the charity’s report provides insufficient information about the number of people who will be helped and the extent of the benefit.\n\nSt George’s Hospital Charity funds other research programs, which makes up 29% of their expenditure on charitable activities,  Our [analysis](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/is-it-better-to-fund-direct-work-or.html?view\u003dsidebar) on this suggests there are some tentative reasons to be positive about research. However, another earlier [study]\n(https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2017/08/donating-to-medical-research-heres-why.html?view\u003dsidebar) suggests that some research areas are relatively overfunded, while others are underfunded.\n\nWe do not have a full picture of the types of research funded by the charity, but from the report we understand that St George’s Hospital Charity has awarded a grant of £127k to study cardiac conditions and £135k to study invasive fungal infection (IFI). \n\nThe research of cardiovascular and infectious diseases respectively accounts for 12% and 11% of research funding in the UK. However, these diseases account for 14% and 18% of the world’s disease burden or 16% and 3% of the UK’s disease burden, measured in terms of the number of healthy life years taken away by the diseases and adjusted for the severity of the diseases. Thus, cardiovascular diseases and perhaps infectious diseases may be underfunded, so donating to these research areas seem relatively sensible. Still, we should be careful not to infer too much from this underfunding, for donors might overfund a research area because the area proves particularly tractable and tends to yield cost-effective health solutions.\n\nFor all the projects mentioned above, one has to note that St George’s Hospital Charity’s charitable expenses accounts for only [0.27%](https://www.stgeorges.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/STGEORGE-ANNUAL-REPORT-2018-19-FINAL-VERSION-min.pdf) of St George’s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust’s annual expenses. We do not know if all or any of the abovementioned projects are fully funded by St George’s Hospital Charity.\n\n**Benchmarking**\n\nHaving reviewed the work of St George’s Hospital Charity under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process would be to compare this to benchmark charities. These benchmark charities have strong cost-effectiveness and evidence for their effectiveness. These benchmark charities should achieve an outcome about as good as saving a life for around £1,500. An example benchmark charity is the [Against Malaria Foundation](https://app.sogive.org/#charity?charityId\u003dagainst-malaria-foundation). However, because of a lack of information in the charity’s annual accounts, we were unable to perform the comparison.\n\nFinally, the charity did not explain why the NHS did not cover what the charity contributed. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that interventions funded by the charity did not meet the NHS\u0027s standards of cost-effectiveness, which are already far less demanding than SoGive\u0027s standards for a benchmark charity. We have learned from a staff member of another NHS charity that NHS charities typically do not consider cost-effectiveness when deciding which projects to fund. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTentative rating: If we had more information about the work of the St George’s Hospital Charity, the charity would probably achieve a Bronze assessment under the SoGive rating methodology. When we describe a charity as Bronze-rated, we mean that the charity’s work likely has a positive impact, but underperforms compared to a Silver-rated charity. Providing St George’s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust with research support, medical equipment, a comfortable environment, capital investment, and staff development may very likely do a limited amount of good. However, we assume by default that a charity does not achieve substantial positive impact in the absence of strong evidence to the contrary. We are basing this assumption on reasons set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/should-you-be-charity-sceptic.html?view\u003dsidebar). Furthermore, a typical NHS charity does not selectively fund projects based on their cost-effectiveness. For tentative ratings, our rating is more prone to change in light of new information.\n\nFor tentative ratings, our rating is more prone to change in light of new information.\n\nFurther information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion of the St George’s Hospital Charity would include:\n\na) a more comprehensive cost assessment of the St George’s Hospital Charity’s projects. Exactly what part of the hospitals\" activities does the charity pay for?\n\nb) a more detailed impact assessment of the charity’s projects. How many people will the charity’s treatment, equipment, and environment respectively help? Does the help have long-lasting impacts? Why is this worth being done by a charity and not by the NHS? What would be the consequences if the charity did not provide its services? ",
