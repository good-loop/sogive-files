  "recommendation": "**To evaluate Samaritans under the SoGive rating methodology, we would need more information.**\n\nSamaritans reduces distress and despair through its confidential emotional support, primarily by providing its phone helpline.\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-sogive-approach-to-assessing.html), we consider two questions:\n- how much does it cost for the charity to do something\n- what is the thing (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)\n\n**More about what Samaritans does**\n\nBased on self-reported information provided historically by Samaritans, we understand that providing helpline service for one time costs around £4.\n\n19% and 2% of the expenditures go respectively to campaigns and research. The latter accounts for such a small percentage of the expenses that we have left research output out of our analysis. Our earlier [analysis](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/is-it-better-to-fund-direct-work-or.html?view\u003dsidebar) has tentatively suggested that peer-reviewed research may have some positive impacts.\n\n**Benchmarking**\n\nAfter a review of the work of Samaritans under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing Samaritans to benchmark charities. These benchmark charities have strong cost-effectiveness and evidence for their effectiveness. For these benchmark charities you should be able to achieve an outcome about as good as saving a life for around £1,500. Example benchmark charities include the [Against Malaria Foundation](https://app.sogive.org/#charity?charityId\u003dagainst-malaria-foundation)\n\nIn performing the comparison, we found that £1,500 can fund roughly 650 helpline calls or other similar care services. According to Samaritans\u0027 18/19 impact report, one-quarter of the callers expressed suicidal feelings. Since these calls are aimed directly at alleviating tremendous distress and preventing people from dying by suicide, we cannot rule out the possibility that 650 of these calls would result in a more positive outcome than saving someone\u0027s life. Only around 0.9% of the callers express seriously suicidal feelings. For the year 2018/19, that would mean around 6 people. However, we know of no evidence that the service provided by Samaritans had a lasting life-saving impact. Furthermore, based on our understanding of Samaritans\u0027 approach to impact and evaluation we do not consider them to be a leader in this field.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe cannot conclude based on the information we currently have whether Samaritans have a more cost-effective impact than the Against Malaria Foundation.\n\nFurther information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion of the work of Samaritans includes:\n(a) research into the exact number of lives saved through Samaritans\n(b) the development of an ethical framework that quantifies distress alleviation\n(c) an impact assessment of Samaritan\u0027s research\n\nFull disclosure: a SoGive Director is a Samaritan volunteer.\n\n",
