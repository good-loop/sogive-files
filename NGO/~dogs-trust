They provide dog training and educational material on responsible dog ownership.\n\nIn 2019, Dogs Trust UK allocated £110,433,000 to charitable activities, across 4 main projects: 1) Rehoming Centres, 2) Preventative work, 3) International work, and 4) Publicity and information. \n\nBreakdown of Projects ([Annual Report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_fileName\u003d0000227523_AC_20191231_E_C.pdf\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA10320186\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_LIFERAY_SHARED_backToSearch\u003dhttps%3A%2F%2Fregister-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk%2Fcharity-search%3Fp_p_id%3Duk_gov_ccew_portlet_CharitySearchPortlet%26amp%3Bp_p_lifecycle%3D1%26amp%3Bp_p_state%3Dnormal%26amp%3Bp_p_mode%3Dview%26amp%3B_uk_gov_ccew_portlet_CharitySearchPortlet_cur%3D1%26amp%3B_uk_gov_ccew_portlet_CharitySearchPortlet_delta%3D20%26amp%3B_uk_gov_ccew_portlet_CharitySearchPortlet_keywords%3D227523%26amp%3B_uk_gov_ccew_portlet_CharitySearchPortlet_orderByCol%3D%26amp%3B_uk_gov_ccew_portlet_CharitySearchPortlet_orderByType%3Dasc%26amp%3B_uk_gov_ccew_portlet_CharitySearchPortlet_priv_r_p_prevCol%3D%26amp%3B_uk_gov_ccew_portlet_CharitySearchPortlet_priv_r_p_useSession%3Dtrue%26amp%3B_uk_gov_ccew_portlet_CharitySearchPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName%3D%252Fsearch-results\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d227523) p. 36):\n\nThe Rehoming Centres comprise a majority of the charitable work done by Dogs Trust (72% of charitable funds go to rehoming centres) (Annual Report p. 36). These centres are the primary source of impact and account for the 14,301 total dogs impacted directly through Dogs Trust (Annual Report p. 4). This included 11,790 dogs that were rehomed, 244 dogs reunited with owners, 292 dogs put to sleep, and 1,726 dogs still in rehoming centers as of December 2019 (Annual Report p. 6). The Dogs Trust’s centres also provided free veterinary care for 326 dogs of homeless people and distributed 1,750 gift parcels to homeless people with dogs (Annual Report p. 10). Sometimes it’s the humans, not dogs, who benefit from the Rehoming Centres, as 183 dog owners would have been forced to stay in an abusive relationship out of fear of what would happen to their dogs, had they not handed their dogs to the Dogs Trust (Annual Report p. 12). Work that contributes to this 72% of total expenditure may also include education for new owners of these dogs, and phone call support for owners with inquiries regarding the adoption of these dogs (Annual Report p. 8).\n\nPreventative work (15% of charitable activities) includes neutering, microchipping, and educating schoolchildren about dog safety (Annual Report p. 36). In the UK through 2019, 422,000 schoolchildren were taught about dog safety (Annual Report p. 14), 19,886 dogs were neutered to prevent unwanted births as well as diseases like testicular cancer, 8,447 dogs were microchipped so that they might be found if they get lost, and 5,222 dogs were given a free health check (Annual Report p. 16). Dogs Trust provides financial assistance to allow owners in genuine need to have their dogs neutered through participating veterinary practices, thus helping dogs that might not have gotten treatment otherwise (Annual Report p. 16). Additionally, Dogs Trust is investing a small portion of funding into research and political action to end puppy smuggling (Annual Report p. 18). The charity does not indicate whether this is an exhaustive list of work that falls under this category. The annual report also contains little information on the number of dogs the schoolchildren, the research efforts, and the political actions may go on to help. Furthermore, the report does not give any indication of the pace at which the charity is progressing towards its research and campaign goals. To learn more about how SoGive analyzes research and campaigns, see the link [here](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-three-question-method-for.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nInternational work (9% of charitable activities) is charitable funding that goes to preventative work across the world (Annual Report p. 36). In particular, this funding is invested in a wholly owned subsidiary called Dogs Trust Worldwide to carry out similar preventative work (neutering, microchipping, and dog safety education) in developing/underdeveloped countries. During the financial year, Dogs Trust Worldwide neutered 20,000 dogs, reached 11,394 dog owners about responsible ownership, provided health checkups for 5,222 dogs, and microchipped 8,500 dogs (Annual Report p. 20). The charity’s report does not provide information, however, on the total amount of expenditure by Dogs Trust Worldwide during the financial year. Neither does the charity disclose total impact statistics of the charity’s other international work, which includes direct work on dogs, education for both the general populace and professionals who handle dogs (Annual Report p. 20).\n\nIn addition, the charity spends about 4% of its charitable expenditures on information and publicity (Annual Report p. 36). It is not clear from the charity’s report what this might entail or how much the work overlaps with other spending categories.\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis**\n\nAfter a review of the work of Dogs Trust under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold-standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved or £5 to avert the suffering of one chicken who is living in very poor conditions) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work.\n\nBased on the funding devoted to charitable activities and the number of dogs impacted, it costs Dogs Trust UK about £5,500 to potentially improve the well-being of 1 dog or to help one individual to escape domestic abuse. However, this is a generous assumption, for if a dog is not rehomed by Dogs Trust, there is no guarantee that it will not be rehomed by some other charity.\n\nThe same donation of £5,500 given to a Gold rated charity would be able to save 1 human life or save 1,100 chickens from severe suffering, and for this reason we believe that the rehoming project underperforms the SoGive Gold Standard. Since this project accounts for 72% of the charity’s work, we believe that the rehoming project can fairly represent the cost-effectiveness of the entire charity.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Dogs Trust as Not Recommended (Firm) under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective and/or\n- We have little indication of cost-effectiveness, and have very high confidence that cost-effectiveness underperforms the Gold Standard, likely by a substantial margin\n",
