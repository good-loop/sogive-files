While there may be positive impacts on well-being from being a member of the Church, we do not believe these are as good as averting greater than 1 year of severe depression each year.\n- For this reason, it is very likely that a donation to LDSGB will achieve less positive impact than the same amount of money given to a Gold-rated organisation.\n\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n\n**More about what LDSGB does - how they spend your donations**\n\nThe Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints (Great Britain) (LDSGB) is a charity that has the objective of promoting and furthering the religious and other charitable work of its parent organisation, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (referred to as ‘the Church’ throughout), especially in the United Kingdom.\n\nLDSGB aims to achieve its objective in the following ways ([2019 annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA12294736\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d242451), pp. 6 and 7): \n- Provision of facilities for religious worship. \"One of the primary objectives of the Charity is to provide temples and meetinghouses to enable religious worship to be undertaken by members of the Church and others\".\n- Religious education. \"Worship services are held each Sunday in meetinghouses where members and non-members are invited to attend and learn about Jesus Christ and how adopting his teachings benefits all\".\n- Religious materials. \"The Charity supplies certain religious materials at no charge to members of the Church and others to help them in their Church work and to improve their learning\".\n- Missionary work. \"Members of the Church are encouraged to share the gospel message and help prepare family members, friends, and other acquaintances who are not Latter-day Saints to be taught by the full time missionaries. \".\n- Family history. \"The Church places great religious significance on tracing family history. Within the community there is also a wide interest in genealogy. The Charity continues to be committed to improving facilities within its Family History Centres throughout the United Kingdom\". \"One of the aims of the Family History Department is to deliver more records to more people and faster by providing timely access to the broadest set of family history records possible\".\n- Work in the community. \"The Charity encourages members of the Church to become actively involved in their local community and provides training materials to assist with this\".\n- Public Affairs. \"The Charity undertakes certain public affairs projects during the year to ensure that the general public has a clear understanding of what the Church teachings stand for\".\n- Promotion of self-reliance and welfare principles. \"The Charity encourages members to become financially self-reliant through employment and education\".\n\nThe charity’s total expenditure of £154M for 2019 could be segmented as follows ([2019 annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA10450442\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d242451), pp. 23, 30 and 37):\n- Charitable donation (67%). On 31 December 2019, LDSGB made a donation to Covent Garden IP Limited (CGIP) of £103M comprising the investment property Alder Castle and all assets and liabilities associated with the related investment activities. CGIP is a charity owned by Property Reserve Inc (PRI), which is the dedicated investment body of the Church. The donation was enabled by a grant of £105M given in 2019 to LDSGB from the Church, which had planned to invest in UK real estate.\n- Charitable activities (32%):\n\t- Provision of worship facilities (18%).\n\t- Missionary work (6.2%).\n\t- Temple and Genealogy Work (3.6%).\n- Religious education (2.8%).\n\t- Community projects (1.2%).\n- Investment management, and other trading activities and finance expenses (0.7%).\n\nThe Church membership in the UK stood at 188k on 31 December 2019 ([2019 annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA10450442\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d242451), p. 8).\n\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does LDSGB compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of LDSGB under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nFurther information about the impact of LDSGB charitable activities on the beneficiaries would be needed in order to estimate its cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, a meaningful comparison could be made based on the total expenditure of £154M, and the Church membership in the UK of 188k. These imply an average cost per member during 2019 of around £820.\n\nFor the above cost to match the SoGive Gold Standard of £200 to avert one year of severe depression, on average, the impact per member per year would have to be an improvement in well-being equivalent to averting about 4 years of severe depression (817/200 \u003d 4.1). While there may be positive impacts on well-being from being a member of the Church, we do not believe these achieve an outcome as good as averting 4 years of severe depression.\n\nThe charitable activities might also reach people who are not members of LDSGB, but they might also not impact all LDSGB members, and the effect on people less strongly connected to LDSGB would likely be smaller. Moreover, the extent of LDSGB counterfactual impact (i.e. the difference between what actually happened and what would have happened without its intervention) is not clear. For example, in addition to the government, in the UK there are numerous other organisations promoting self-reliance and welfare principles. Consequently, it is highly likely that a donation to LDSGB will achieve less positive impact than the same amount of money given to a Gold-rated organisation.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints (Great Britain) as Not Recommended (Firm) under the SoGive methodology.
