Interestingly the figures both happen to coincide with a round number of pounds per month. We assume this is because the charity is doing a periodic calculation of the cost and then updating the figures (and presumably not anything suspicious). There doesn\u0027t appear to be any quantification of the number of beneficiaries in the accounts (http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Accounts/Ends35/0001074935_AC_20141231_E_C.pdf) so we are reliant on the charity\u0027s own calcs in this case.",
