  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**The Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (CAFOD) is rated as More Information Needed on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- CAFOD provides religious, humanitarian and development support in the UK and developing countries, and also campaigns for global justice, with the aim of allowing everyone to live a full and dignified life\n- CAFOD’s charitable activities are many and varied, including work relating to international development, disaster relief, UK development education, and advocacy and campaigning\n- Unfortunately, the breadth of CAFOD’s work, and the incomplete information on its impact renders detailed, high-confidence cost-effectiveness analysis impossible, and thus we cannot form specific opinions on their work under the SoGive methodology. \n- Further information, including CAFOD and its partners’ delivery costs for each project, and more comprehensive annual impact assessments (including number of beneficiaries and quantitative impact made) would aid our ability to analyse the CAFOD’s cost per beneficiary. \n- For these reasons, CAFOD is currently rated as More Information Needed. \n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what CAFOD does - how they spend your donations**\n\nCAFOD’s [mission](https://cafod.org.uk/About-us/How-we-work/Our-Common-Home-vision) is inspired by Pope Francis’ \"Laudato Si’\", and seeks to reach those in greatest need, thereby saving lives and reducing suffering. To this end, CAFOD also supports communities in their quest for autonomy, whilst seeking to remove and reshape the fundamental causes of \"poverty, vulnerability, inequality, injustice, and exclusion\". Additionally, they seek to reform environmentally unsustainable behaviours. Finally, CAFOD also aims to educate and inspire the Catholic community of England and Wales to unite in the pursuit of doing good. \n\nCAFOD’s 2019/2020 [Financial Report](https://cafod.org.uk/content/download/53545/749470/version/2/file/CAFOD%20Reports%20of%20the%20Trustees%20and%20Financial%20Statements%202019%20-%202020.PDF) shows charitable expenditure of £40.3m (not including £5.6m spent on fundraising). This expenditure can be broken up into £22.6m (56% of total charitable expenditure) spent on international development, £13.3m (33%) on disaster relief, £1.9m (5%) on UK development education, and £2.4m (6%) on advocacy and campaigning. \n\nMoreover, CAFOD donations are often channeled to partner organisations via grants - in [2020](https://cafod.org.uk/content/download/54220/754989/version/1/file/Annual%20Report%20Summary%202020.pdf), they provided 545 grants (totalling £22.4m) in support of \"life changing work\", and also released £921k to quickly support emergency responses, for crises that were often \"not visible in the UK media\". CAFOD [responded](https://cafod.org.uk/content/download/53225/745910/version/2/file/Autumn%20Update%20Final.pdf) to the catastrophic Beirut port explosion, providing 44,575 hot meals, 8,713 medicines, first aid, legal aid, and more, whilst assisting in cleanup. CAFOD has also done extensive fundraising for the Coronavirus Appeal, focusing its efforts on Brazil, Bangladesh and Syria. In Brazil, CAFOD is offering shelter, food, hygiene support, and health services access to over 38 thousand people who are without homes, or living in inadequate and/or unstable housing. \nCAFOD’s reported accomplishments (which it states are only \"some examples\" of its cumulative work) also include supporting over 37,000 households in Aleppo, who are rebuilding their lives after the Syrian war, and the construction of 1,500 latrines, and the provision of hygiene materials, assisting over 150,000 refugees in Sudan. Additionally, over 100,000 people in Myanmar have attended CAFOD-run activities, which promote inclusiveness and equality (both political and economic) for people of all faiths and ethnicities. CAFOD is also currently working on the Zimbabwe and Zambia food crisis.\n\nCAFOD’s work is also visible in the UK itself, with more than 300 16-17 year old young leaders campaigning for climate change action. \n\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does CAFOD compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of CAFOD under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as doubling someone’s consumption (spending) for one year for £50, or saving a life for £5,000) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. \n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\nUnfortunately, the breadth of CAFOD’s work, and the incomplete information on its impact renders detailed, high-confidence cost-effectiveness analysis impossible, and thus we cannot form specific opinions on their work under the SoGive methodology. \n\nThis is because CAFOD’s programmes are umbrella terms, which cover many, disparate charitable activities, and so the specific costs of their projects are unavailable. Moreover, CAFOD’s impact reports do not comprehensively list all their projects, and their associated impacts. Many of the impact figures also appear to be collated across years (ie. not reported in annual figures). This may very well be information that CAFOD itself would be hard pressed to collate, given the nature of much of its work (ie. providing direct grants, and disaster relief, by channelling funds to its partners, as opposed to directly administering its projects). However, CAFOD could feasibly ask their partners to collate such information on their behalf. Alternatively, CAFOD could demonstrate that particular approaches are justified, if they have been demonstrably effective in similar projects conducted elsewhere. \n\nFor example, as part of the effort to combat the [food crisis in Zimbabwe](https://cafod.org.uk/content/download/53277/746390/version/1/file/CAFOD%20six%20month%20update%20on%20the%20Zimbabwe%20Zambia%20crisis%20July%202020.pdf), CAFOD is offering communities in the Diocese of Hwange access to food, in exchange for contributing their labour to building a water supply line, which will pipe water to a clinic and a community. It is estimated that this access to water will benefit 10,000 people, but there is no information on the costs of delivering this program, and the specific number of people accessing food is not included. \n\nCAFOD’s broad focus and the interconnected (and sometimes overlapping) nature of their reported output makes connecting outputs to specific programmes and expenditure amounts unfeasible. With more detailed information, and a comprehensive list of outputs, this analysis could be possible. \n\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that CAFOD’s work appears to largely focus upon prioritising neglected, tractable, and important issues (ie. issues that are time-sensitive, severe, or very large in scope). Many of the reports are from operations in the developing world, and operations like these generally appear to have greater cost-effectiveness (relative to their counterparts that focus on developed countries like the UK). This general rule is likely to apply to CAFOD, given what we know of their operations. In particular, their international development activities alone (leaving aside crisis assistance, which also largely assists developing nations) account for more than half the fund’s expenditure.\n\nFurther information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion of the work of CAFOD would be:\n\n(a) more comprehensive picture of the costs involved in delivering their work (eg. the cost of any particular project)\n\n(b) more comprehensive impact assessments, both in quantity and depth (the extent to which people in need have been helped, eg. how have the households in Aleppo been supported, what impact has this had on their lives, etc.), including the work of their partner organisations that they provide grants to\n\n(c) more comprehensive picture about the number of people benefiting from all of their programs, including the work of their partner organisations that they provide grants to\n\n(d) more information on the extent to which CAFOD collaborates with NGOs, volunteers on the ground, and local governments, to achieve the impact reported. This is because any estimation that doesn’t take into account external sources of assistance would then lead to an underestimate of the cost per beneficiary. \n\n(e) information about the process they use for allocating funds to partner organisations - how do they prioritise which partners and projects to support?\n\n(f) some indication of CAFOD\u0027s strategy. This is because the information about cost-effectiveness discussed in this overview of CAFOD is based on their past activities. While this will often be a good indication of what a charity’s future activities will look like, sometimes a charity will change what they are focusing on, meaning that additional donations could be more or less cost-effective than the average past donation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate CAFOD as More Information Needed under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective\n- We have no indication of cost-effectiveness, or we do not judge those indications to be promising\n",
