  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**To evaluate the work of Plan International UK, we would need more information, but the charity is promising**\n\n- Plan International UK (PIUK) provides humanitarian and development support in developing countries with an emphasis on girls and young women.\n- Plan International Worldwide’s reach and impact statistics claim to have directly supported 50,905,094 children with their €910M spending in 2020\n- The average cost per person supported (around €18 or approximately £15) is relatively low compared to other charities in the SoGive database (including those working in the developed world), which is a promising sign\n- However, since the charity is active in many areas, and because some of their work is in collaboration with partners, we do not have enough information about the average benefit provided per person reached and therefore cannot form a confident opinion about their effectiveness\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what Plan International does - how they spend your donations**\n\nPlan International’s [2020 annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA10901054\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d276035) indicates that their main charitable activities in 2020 made an impact in 43 countries through 129 different projects. Their previous strategy, from 2017 to 2020, categorized activities under 5 goals:\n\n1. Equality for Girls\n2. Young People Empowered into Success Adulthood\n3. Resilience in Fragile Communities\n4. Diverse and Effective Partnerships\n5. Organisational Excellence\n\nStarting in 2021, PlUK has begun a new three-year strategy with 4 new goals:\n\n1. GOAL: TO BUILD ON THE STRENGTHS OF OUR LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT AND HUMANITARIAN WORK\nPlUK is currently focusing on high impact areas to create long lasting change for girls.\n\n2. GOAL: TO CONTINUE TO BE A POWERFUL INFLUENCING VOICE FOR CHANGE\nThe charity is building on their ability to achieve change through strong and focused influencing work with girls’ voices at its core - securing impactful changes to advance girls’ rights.\n\n3. GOAL: TO MAXIMISE OUR RESOURCES FOR IMPACT\nPlUK will prioritise securing income that can be used to deliver maximum impact for children and young people and will prioritise opportunities that transform the lives of girls and young women.\n\n4. GOAL: TO DELIVER ON OUR AMBITION TO BE A MORE YOUTH-CENTRED ORGANISATION \nPlUK aims to become a more youth-centred organisation, developing and delivering a plan which embeds a youth-centred approach throughout everything they do. \n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does PlUK compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of PlUK under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar). For more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\nBecause of how PlUK reports their reach and impact statistics by reflecting whole projects, and are not limited to the proportion of the projects funded from the UK, we decided to use [Plan International Worldwide’s impact statistics](https://plan-international.org/plan-international-worldwide-annual-review-2020) instead. They claim to have directly supported 50,905,094 children with their €910M spending in 2020. This comes out to around €18 or approximately £15 on average to help a person in need. \n\nHowever, since the charity is active in many areas, such as disaster relief, food supplies, female empowerment, education, etc. the range of outcomes complicates our efforts to form an opinion on their overall cost-effectiveness. Also, some of their work is in collaboration with partners, so the true cost of their impact may be higher than stated. We know that 35% of 2020 PlUK charitable expenditure was on education, 34% on disaster risk management, 8% on sanitation, and 7% on campaigning \u0026 awareness, but would need more granular information about outcomes achieved before we can form a confident view about their effectiveness.\n\nThe cost per person is relatively low compared to other charities in the SoGive database (including those working in the developed world), which is a promising sign in terms of cost-effectiveness. However, this is not enough for us to form a firm view of the impact of PlUK’s work: we also want to know about the amount of good done per person helped.\n\nFurther information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion of Plan International UK\u0027s work would be:\n(a) more comprehensive picture of the costs involved in delivering Plan International\u0027s work\n(b) more comprehensive impact assessments, both in quantity and depth\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Plan International UK as More Information Needed (promising) under the SoGive methodology. \n",
