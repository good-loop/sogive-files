  "description": "Center for physiotherapy and treatment of persons with disabilities.\n20 of them are permanent residents and are feed and cared for in the center.\nIt is unclear wether they cater for older disabled persons. \n\nThey are aiming to increase capacity to serve over 80-100 persons. \n",
  "recommendation": "Most of what is received is sent to Bangladesh. Of it, half has been going to construction projects and half to staff salaries. The numbers are not big but this is an expensive cause (to care for children with disabilities, half of them living full time in the residence). There is potential, when construction stops, to serve many more people and invest more in equipment, services, and utilities, significantly improving quality of life of the population with disabilities. There is potential for life-saving value, since many people with disabilities do not have other access to specialized care there. There should be, in theory, significant impact on Quality-Adjusted Life Years for persons with disabilities. However, at the same time that income grew, information shared reduced, the charity does not publish most of this information.\nAn in-depth study on the situation of Bhola and the expenses of past years could lead to a better valuation. (Best case scenario, they are saving lives of persons with disability on a yearly basis, and they are the only institution able to do that in a 20 square KM area. However, I don\u0027t think the counterfactual is that strong, if they did not exist, 78 children would not die, they would have been taken care by their families and they would have worse lives in general.\n\nEven the alleged improvement needs to be questioned. The blog mentions 36 boys sleeping in one room. ",
