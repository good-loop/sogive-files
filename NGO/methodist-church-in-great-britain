  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**The Methodist Church in Great Britain is rated as More Information Needed on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- The Methodist Church in Great Britain is the umbrella organisation of Methodist churches, schools, and other organisations in Great Britain and is the worldwide mother church of Methodism, a Protestant Christian denomination.\n- Although the organisation describes a large variety of charitable activities it performs, it does not disclose firm numbers for these activities, including both the number of people impacted by each project and the typical impact on well-being for these people.\n- Therefore, without more information, we cannot produce a confident assessment of the effectiveness of The Methodist Church in Great Britain.\n\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n\n**More about what The Methodist Church in Great Britain does - how they spend your donations**\n\nThe Methodist Church in Great Britain oversees a variety of Methodist organizations involved in worship (churches), education (schools and religious education), and international aid. Internally, it trains and supports clergy and provides its church members with leadership, courses, events, and other forms of support. Externally, it coordinates with partner churches, evangelises Christianity, campaigns for various causes, and provides international aid. The [2019/2020 annual report] (https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA10998853\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d4047572) lays out its expenditures and services.\n\nAlthough local churches, circuits, and districts operate under The Methodist Church in Great Britain, these entities’ finances are not included in the report (p.4). Several entities associated with the organisation operate with separate finances and operations, and several others are registered as independent charities or businesses (p.39). Our analysis here includes these other entities only insofar as The Methodist Church in Great Britain supports them.\n\nAccording to the Church’s [2020 statistics](https://www.methodist.org.uk/for-churches/statistics-for-mission/2020-statistics-reports/), there were approximately 4,000 active churches at the end of the financial year with about 164,000 church members. There were also approximately 28,000 participants in Local Ecunemical Parternships with other Churches. After removing any double counting, there were about 177,000 people associated with The Methodist Church in Great Britain, either as members or as participants in Local Ecunemical Partnerships.\n\nIn 2019/2020 the Methodist Church in Great Britain spent £37.2 million on charitable activities and £7.2 million on fundraising costs for a total expenditure of £44.4 million (p.50). All other overhead costs are included in these figures. In our analysis we will allocate the fundraising costs proportionally to the Church’s activities. These activities can be broken down into the following eight categories (p.9): building communities; children, youth, and families; evangelism and growth; global relations; learning network; the Methodist Council and governance; ministries; property.\n\nThe Church spent £12 million on global relations (p.50). This involved helping over 100 partner churches and organisations across the globe by supporting their capacity for evangelising, advocating on social issues, responding to emergencies, and responding to violence (p.11-12). It also involved running a program to send and receive volunteers. The Church spent about £700,000 in General grants, approximately 80% of which was given as a direct result of the impact of Covid-19.\n\nThe global relations expenditure also helped to support All We Can, the Methodist Relief and Development Fund (p.13). Although it is unclear exactly to what degree All We Can’s income came from the Church, we know there was a grant of £1.4 million (p.18). In 2019/2020, All We Can assisted 989,000 people. It works by facilitating a variety of long-term development programmes; it prefers a long-term partnership approach as opposed to project-focused funding. All We Can additionally helped 64,000 people in response to the following emergencies: Covid-19, Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas, the explosion in the port of Beirut, and the refugee crises in Jordan and Bangladesh.\n\nThe Church spent £9.2 million on the Methodist Council and governance (p.50). This involved providing review, spiritual leadership, and broad guidance for the Church (p.14-15).\n\nThe Church spent £7.3 million on evangelism and growth (p.50). This involved providing resources such as guidance, meetings, and courses in order to help members strategise for missionary work (p.11).\n\nThe Church spent £5.6 million on property (p.50). This involved developing strategies for the Church’s buildings, helping circuits and districts to develop their property plans, publishing property information, promoting property strategy to the Church, and providing support to managing trustees (p.17).\n\nThe Church spent £9.1 million on the remaining four categories (learning network; building communities; children, youth, and families; ministries) (p.50). These involved providing resources and support to Methodist Church members (p.13-14) and their families (p.10-11), connecting with other churches, campaigning, publishing Methodist information (p.9-10), and providing training and theological education to preachers (p.15-17).\n\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does The Methodist Church in Great Britain compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of The Methodist Church in Great Britain under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as averting one year of severe depression for £200, or doubling consumption (spending) for one year for £50) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nWithout more information about the impact of The Methodist Church in Great Britain’s various activities, we cannot give a confident assessment of its effectiveness. Specifically, for each of the eight categories, we do not know how many people were impacted or how much the average person was impacted. The global relations category comes the closest by citing the number of people helped (989,000 overall and 64,000 through emergency relief), but we do not know the specifics of how they were helped, so we have very little indication of how much good was actually done.\n\nThe Church also does not provide any quantified estimate of how much its members’ lives are improved by participation in church services or other Methodist activities. If we knew how much a person’s life is impacted by participation in the Church, we could calculate how effective the Church is in helping its members. For example, if we assume that the categories \"the Methodist Council and governance\", \"property\", \"learning network\", \"children, youth and families\", and \"ministries\" are devoted to helping the 177,000 members of the Church, this would mean the Church is spending approximately £120 per member. At this cost, in order to meet the SoGive Gold Standard benchmark, we would expect the Church to bring about an increase in well-being equivalent to helping more than half of its members to avert a year of severe depression.\n\nAdditionally, even given the appropriate data on impact, we would also need to be able to disentangle the work of The Methodist Church in Great Britain from its adjacent organisations. For example, we would need to know how much the support from the entire organisation is helping individual church members as opposed to the support they receive from their own churches.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGiven the gaps in information on the number of people helped and the amount they are helped, both in the organisation as a whole and within its different subsections, we rate The Methodist Church in Great Britain as More Information Needed under the SoGive methodology.\n",
