  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**The Rhodes Trust is rated as Not Recommended (firm) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- The Rhodes Trust is composed of three charitable funds: the Public Purposes Fund, the Cecil Rhodes Scholarship Fund, and the Rhodes Trust Horizon Fund, all of which are aimed at advancing education and increasing educational access for students around the world.  \n- Based on their 2019-2020 annual report, The Rhodes Trust reported that they spent an average of £77,795 per scholar.\n- When comparing this to the SoGive Gold Standard benchmark of £5,000 per life saved, The Rhodes Trust severely underperforms in terms of cost-effectiveness. For the cost of supporting one scholar, a SoGive Gold-rated life-saving organisation could be expected to save at least 15 lives.\n- For this reason, it is quite clear that The Rhodes Trust does not meet the recommended cost-effectiveness standards, and is thus rated as Not Recommended. \n\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n\n**More about what The Rhodes Trust does - how they spend your donations**\n\nThe Rhodes Trust comprises three different charitable funds: the Cecil Rhodes Scholarship Fund, the Public Purposes Fund, and the Rhodes Trust Horizon Fund. Each fund has its own set of charitable goals.\n\n*Cecil Rhodes Scholarship Fund*\nThe primary purpose of the Cecil Rhodes Scholarship Fund is to provide scholarships to enable students from many countries to undertake either second undergraduate or postgraduate degrees, primarily at the University of Oxford. Each scholarship covers both tuition fees and maintenance during the tenure of the scholarship. In 2019, 212 of these scholarships were awarded. \n\n*Public Purposes Fund*\nThe Public Purposes Fund (PPF) has the goal of promotion or advancement, in any part of the British Commonwealth of Nations or in the United States of America, of any educational or other charitable purposes in such a manner as the Rhodes Trust thinks fit. \n\n*Rhodes Trust Horizon Fund*\nThe Rhodes Trust Horizon Fund was established in 2014 under the terms of the 1946 Rhodes Trust Act, with very broad goals to promote and advance education and other charitable purposes in any part of the world. Its key partnership activities include the Atlantic Institute and the Schmidt Science Fellows. The Schmidt Science Fellows programme trains the next generation of science leaders through a combination of workshops across the world and a unique postdoctoral study in a field different from their current expertise. Fellows are exposed to new perspectives and approaches to solving the world’s most pressing problems and advancing discovery. According to their 2019/2020 annual report pg. 50, in 2020, 22 Schmidt Science Fellowships were awarded. The Atlantic Institute admits fellows who are mid-career leaders from a variety of disciplines, and share a common goal of creating most inclusive and just communities. The activities of the Schmidt Science Fellowship and the Atlantic Institute make up 18% and 15% of the Rhodes Trust’s expenditure profile currently. \n\nAccording to the 2019/2020 annual report (pg. 45), direct scholar costs, including University fees, stipends, travel, medical, and support costs constituted 37% of the Rhodes Trust’s expenditure profile. Another 14% went to Shared Services and Rhodes House Operating Costs. Finally another 8% went to Global Engagement  and Events and 7% went to the Scholar Programmes and Support Costs. The Rhodes Trust’s total annual expenditure for 2019 amounted to £28,840,139. \n\nThe charity provides no further breakdown of how they allocate their resources to specific activities and also does not delineate much about the specific impact they create. \n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does The Rhodes Trust compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of The Rhodes Trust under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar). For more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\nIn their annual report for the year 2019, The Rhodes Trust reports that their total expenditure was £28,840,139. In the report, they claim that they spent an average of £77,795 per scholar in 2019. Comparing this to the Gold Standard of £5,000 per life saved, The Rhodes Trust appears to severely underperform. In order for them to be deemed cost effective in SoGive’s terms their scholarship must achieve an outcome at least as good as saving 15 lives, which seems highly implausible. At the very least, we can be confident that the direct benefit to the recipient of the scholarship cannot be this large. \n\nIt could be argued that the indirect benefits of the research undertaken by the beneficiaries could be substantial. However, no evidence of this is provided, and plausibly even greater benefits could be obtained by issuing smaller grants to many more recipients. In order for us to reconsider this position, we would want to see evidence that the research being funded is particularly valuable, including the criteria which the Rhodes Trust uses to decide how to prioritise and allocate funding. \n\nBreaking this down further, just looking at their Scholarship Programme, for which the trust spent £16,765,832 and awarded 212 scholarships, this amounts to £79,084 per scholar. Similarly, with the Schmidt Science Fellows, the trust spent £4,369,033 and sponsored 22 fellows, so an average of £198,592 per fellow. \n\nWhile the Rhodes Trust is enabling hundreds of students worldwide to achieve a one-of-a-kind education that they would have otherwise probably not been able to access, given the costs of this education it seems highly unlikely that the benefits are sufficiently large enough to compare favourably to those achieved by SoGive Gold-rated organisations.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate The Rhodes Trust as Not Recommended on the SoGive rating scale. \n",
