  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**Samaritan’s Purse is rated as Not Recommended (firm)**\n\n- The object of Samaritan’s Purse (SPI) is the advancement of the Christian faith through education projects and poverty relief. SPI provides church support, emergency relief and development assistance to suffering people around the world with the aim of demonstrating God’s love without regard to the race, creed, gender, religion or ethnicity of the beneficiaries\n- The majority of SPI’s spending goes toward Operation Christmas Child, which collects donations of shoebox gifts and distributes them to children for the cost of about £22 per gift\n- We find it unlikely that shoebox gifts would have a comparable impact to the same amount donated to our benchmark charities. For example, a charity that meets the SoGive Gold Standard would be able to avert over one month of severe depression for the same cost. Additionally, the charity’s other projects do not have publicly available metrics for us to form an impact assessment\n- For the reasons above, SPI is rated as Not Recommended (firm) under the SoGive rating methodology\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what Samaritan\u0027s Purse does - how they spend your donations**\n\nSPI’s [2021 Annual Report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA11207424\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d1001349) outlines the details of the £7.9 million that they spent during their fiscal year.\n\nThe vast majority of their charitable expenditure fell into three categories: \n\n*Operation Christmas Child (OCC)*\nSPI’s main programme is Operation Christmas Child, which constituted 73% of their spending. The charity collects donations of shoebox gifts filled with toys, school supplies, and hygiene items and distributes them to children around the world by partnering with local churches. More detail about the program can be found on their [website](https://www.samaritanspurse.org/operation-christmas-child/mission-and-history/).\n\nIn addition to OCC, SPI also spends 2% of their funds on The Greatest Journey, a programme that trains volunteers to teach a discipleship course for gift recipients, which encourages boys and girls to join the church community.\n\n*Emergency Response*\nSPI utilises 10% of their funds to respond to emergencies around the world by funding relief efforts and deploying their Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to serve directly in the field. Their beneficiaries are both in developing countries (such as water, sanitation and hygiene) as well as in the UK (such as food banks).\n\n*Long Term Development*\n5% of the charity’s expenditure goes toward building the capacity of participating churches to holistically, directly, measurably raise the quality of life of vulnerable people in their local communities.\n\nAccording to SPI, their strategy moving forward will focus on the following:\n- Life-saving relief aid, including going to difficult places to assist those who are facing the effects of war, famine, poverty and disease\n- Development projects in Africa and Asia which increase economic and health security through the provision of water and livelihood projects\n- Resourcing of churches and deeper affiliation with the UK church community\n- Expanding their medical capacity, including medical staff and supplies\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Samaritan\u0027s Purse compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of SPI under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nIn performing the comparison, we have focused on Samaritan’s Purse’s main programme, Operation Christmas Child, which accounts for 73% of their charitable expenditure. The charity collected and distributed 265,975 gifts with the £5,830,964 allocated to the programme, coming out to around £22 per gift. In order for OCC to meet the SoGive Gold Standard, we would have to believe that the benefit that a child receives from a gift is sufficiently large to warrant the cost, which could avert over one month of severe depression if directed at a charity that meets the SoGive Gold Standard. While it is possible that some of these kids may be receiving their first gift ever, we find it unlikely that a shoebox gift would have enough meaning to a child for it to have an impact on wellbeing as good as averting one month of severe depression.\n\nBased on the SoGive methodology, we typically assess charities based on the impacts that they intend to achieve. We’ve reviewed their website and are not aware of any other intended impacts of the gift beyond its intrinsic impact, but it’s also possible that SPI believes that this happiness is incidental and that the true purpose of the gift is to encourage children to become Christians. If this is the case, we would need to form a different analysis.\n\nOutside of OCC, we cannot provide the cost-effectiveness assessment for a donated pound allocated to other SPI projects. This is because projects are undertaken with partner organisations and we do not have a cost breakdown between projects. \n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSamaritan’s Purse is rated as Not Recommended under the SoGive rating methodology. We are relatively confident that the charity’s main programme, Operation Christmas Child, possesses lower cost-effectiveness than our benchmark charities.\n\nFurther information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion of the work of Samaritan\u0027s Purse would be:\n(a) more comprehensive picture of the costs involved in their other programs\n(b) more comprehensive impact assessments, both in quantity and depth (e.g. How much does receiving a shoebox gift affect a child\u0027s wellbeing?)\n",
