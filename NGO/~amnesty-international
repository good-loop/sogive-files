  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**Amnesty International is rated as More Information Needed on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- Amnesty International is a global movement of more than 10 million people in over 150 countries and territories who campaign to end abuses of human rights. They do this through research, advocacy and lobbying, and campaigns and action.\n- In 2020 they spent [€288m globally](https://www.amnesty.org/en/2020-global-financial-report/) and published 130 reports on human rights abuses and ran 361 calls to urgent action.\n- In order to better understand the impact of their work we would need more information on the specific costs of campaigns and the specific outcomes achieved by their programmes, and an evaluation of what would have happened otherwise, e.g. how soon changes to policy would have occurred or when political prisoners would have been released without Amnesty International\u0027s work.\n- Overall, we think that more information is needed in order to properly determine if Amnesty International is having an impact per pound donated that is similar to the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks.\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what Amnesty International does - how they spend your donations**\n\nAs a result of legal restrictions associated with activities deemed political under the charity law of England and Wales and the global nature of Amnesty International\u0027s work, there are several different entities reporting expenditure associated with Amnesty International within the UK. [On their website](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/our-finances) they state that \"every £1 you give to Amnesty International UK allows us to protect our human rights, here in the UK and around the world\". Therefore, due to the international and cross-subsidised nature of the work done by Amnesty International we have decided to analyse Amnesty International\u0027s global expenditure, rather than UK specific expenditure. \n\nIn 2020, Amnesty International spent their total funds as follows (specific examples of outputs listed below come from page 8 onwards of [this report](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/fin40/4743/2021/en/)):\n\n\n*Goal 1: Reclaiming Freedoms*\n\n- Amnesty continued to expose and raise awareness of human rights violations.\n- Of spending committed to their goals in 2020, 35% was committed to goal 1, so the non-project costs-adjusted expenditure was €100m.\nExamples of specific outputs claimed include (these outputs may not be 100% attributable to Amnesty International and will likely be the result of numerous individuals/organisations work):\n- The release of a statement signed by more than 100 civil society organisations from around the world denouncing the risks posed by governments’ increasing use of digital surveillance technologies as part of their response to the Covid-19 pandemic\n- In Russia the Supreme Court reduced prison sentences of two prisoners of conscience, Yan Sidorov and Vlad Mordasov\n- In the Americas, an additional 6 countries ratified the Escazú Agreement (an environmental human rights treaty) bringing the total number of ratifications to 11, the number needed for the treaty to enter into force\n- In December 2020, after years of campaigning and advocacy by Amnesty, Argentina\u0027s Congress passed a law to fully decriminalize abortion\n\n*Goal 2: Ensuring Equal Rights for All.*\n\n- Amnesty contributed to changes in laws, policies, and practice, particularly by pushing for the development or adoption of new pieces of legislation and policies which will advance gender justice and the fight against discrimination.\n- Of spending committed to their goals in 2020, 14% was committed to goal 2, so the non-project costs-adjusted expenditure was €40m.\nExamples of specific outputs claimed include (these outputs may not be 100% attributable to Amnesty International and will likely be the result of numerous individuals/organisations work): \n- The government of Sierra Leone introducing a policy allowing pregnant girls to attend school\n- The launch of the \"One Step Closer\" campaign in March 2020 in Hungary, highlighting the existing gender pay gap in both public and private sectors, 30 companies committed to publish their gender pay gap figures by March 2021\n- Some of the Mercury MENA (Middle East and North Africa) workers started receiving their compensation in 2020, after having worked for months without pay on some of Qatar’s most prestigious infrastructure projects.\n\n*Goal 3: Responding to Crises*\n\n\n- Amnesty work to ensure those affected by conflict, crises, torture, have access to adequate protection and assistance.\n- Of spending committed to their goals in 2020, 16% was committed to goal 3, so the non-project costs-adjusted expenditure was €46m.\nExamples of specific outputs claimed include (these outputs may not be 100% attributable to Amnesty International and will likely be the result of numerous individuals/organisations work):\n- 9 individuals being released from Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s detention centres in the USA\n- In Finland the annual \"refugee quota\" was increased by 200 bringing the total number to 1,050 for 2021\n- Amnesty’s Crisis Evidence Lab collaborated with Regional Offices to respond to emerging crises in Ethiopia and Nagorno Karabakh - verifying open-source videos of possible war crimes to complement field research conducted by country researchers \n\n*Goal 4: Ensuring Accountability*\n\n- Amnesty works with intergovernmental organisations through research, consistent engagement with key actors and advocacy at the international and national levels, to ensure regional and global human rights mechanisms are reinforced where national rights protection is failing.\n- Of spending committed to their goals in 2020, 18% was committed to goal 4, so the non-project costs-adjusted expenditure was €52m.\nExamples of specific outputs claimed include (these outputs may not be 100% attributable to Amnesty International and will likely be the result of numerous individuals/organisations work):\n- The investigation of potential human rights abuses due to environmental degradation and pollution caused by four gold mines operating in the Central African Republic, two weeks after Amnesty\u0027s report was released - with good local and regional media coverage - the mining companies abandoned the mining sites.\n- JBS, a Brazilian company, the largest meat packing company in the world, publicly committed to monitor its indirect supply chain by 2025 following the launch of a report exposing that illegally grazed cattle had entered JBS’ supply chain.\n\n*Goal 5: Movement Growth*\n\n- Amnesty International aims to become a larger, stronger and more diverse movement as they believe their greater capacity to achieve human rights impact is strengthened through active and diverse participation at all levels.\n- Of spending committed to their goals in 2020, 17% was committed to goal 5, so the non-project costs-adjusted expenditure was €49m.\n- At the end of 2020 Amnesty reported a supporter base of 10.7 million, up 37% from 7.8 million in 2019. (A supporter is defined as a person who has completed at least one action, provided Amnesty their contact details and has given their consent for Amnesty to contact them). They also had an increase in single donors from 0.5 million in 2018 to 0.9 million in 2020.\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Amnesty International compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of Amnesty International’s work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold rating, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert 1 year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nGiven Amnesty International\u0027s total expenditure their work would need to produce impact equivalent to around 58,000 lives saved or averting just under 1.5 million years of severe depression in order for them to reach SoGive’s Gold Standard. This is plausible if their research and campaigning work results in improvements in legislation and human rights that affect all inhabitants of a country, and brings about positive social change that otherwise would have happened much later e.g. advancing women’s or LGBTQ rights. However, we would need much more detailed information on their outputs and work with and reliance on other organisations and stakeholders in order to assess this. \n\nAmnesty International do have some frameworks for assessing their impact on a case study basis ([see here](https://www.amnesty.org/en/about-us/how-were-run/assessing-impact/)) but these reports tend to identify lessons learnt and areas for improvement, and they don’t often explicitly acknowledge total sums spent on each specific campaign. Further these case studies are published on an ad-hoc basis and don’t cover all of their work and actions. Amnesty International have also published [theories of change](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol10/3165/2016/en/) for each of their goals which is promising, but further evaluation of these theories of change (on the back of Amnesty International actually carrying out the projects) and which steps have been proven to work and which haven’t would be welcomed.  \n\nFurther information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion of the work of Amnesty International would include:\n- A much more comprehensive overview of how money has been spent on different campaigns and projects. Their global financial report doesn’t cover this in sufficient detail and due to the number of independent entities (e.g country-specific sections) and the International Secretariat (which coordinates the worldwide movement and provides support for global governance structures.and subsidiaries) it is very hard to reconcile how much money was spent on any specific campaign or research report. It may be that certain campaigns or cause areas are more cost-effective than others (due to Amnesty International’s relative strengths in an area or due to an increased likelihood of successful outcomes).\n- A complete list of research reports written, campaigns and actions taken annually, and the cost of each output. For example, they list 130 reports published in 2020, 361 urgent calls to action and at least 4.5m actions taken as part of the \"write for rights\" campaign for the 10 individuals featured in the campaign as [outputs in 2020](https://www.amnesty.org/en/2020-global-financial-report/). However it’s unclear what funds were spent to achieve each of these outputs, and even which of Amnesty International\u0027s own goals they fall under (e.g. what was the title of these 130 reports, and what was the content of the 361 calls to action?). \n- A list of the outcomes associated with each campaign (or at least the intermediate outcomes, as some of Amnesty International\u0027s work is more long term in nature) e.g. what happened as a result of the 361 calls to action, and what outcomes were achieved for the 10 individuals featured in the \"write for rights\" campaign?\n- More detailed reporting on where their work relies on partner organisations and external stakeholders and how integral to the success of each project their partnerships were. They already do this to some extent as they acknowledge that \"working with and through external partners (10% of all outcomes reported identified partnerships with external stakeholders as a key element in their success) was one of the key factors that allowed Amnesty to achieve change across Goals One to Four\" (page 7 [here](https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/FIN4047432021ENGLISH.pdf)). However, greater detail on their methodology for determining this figure would be very beneficial in order to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of their work.\n- A fuller analysis would also assess management capability. For example, this would involve assessing Amnesty International’s capabilities around Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (or MEL) to ensure that they are learning from their mistakes (and not simply publishing evaluation reports that don’t change anything), and understanding how the leadership sets strategy and selects projects; in particular, how the charity incorporates cost-effectiveness thinking into its strategic decisions.\n\nFor more information on how we would conduct cost-effectiveness analysis of their lobbying and campaigning work if they provided more data on outputs  under our 3 question method please click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-three-question-method-for.html?q\u003dresearch\u0026view\u003dsidebar)\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze ratings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate Amnesty International as More Information Needed under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective\n- We have no indication of cost-effectiveness, or we do not judge those indications to be promising",
