Annual Costs \u003d 32,888 + 407\n\nunited-synagogue\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe United Synagogue is rated as Not Recommended (firm) on the SoGive ratings scale.\n\n•\tThe United Synagogue provides Orthodox Judaism services in the UK.\n•\tThey provide this at a cost of approximately £88 per practising member.\n•\tWhile the United Synagogue may provide some positive net impact to wellbeing, we believe this cannot come close to what is required to achieve a Gold Standard rating.\n•\tBased on this, we rate the United Synagogue as Not Recommended (Firm) under the SoGive methodology\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what The United Synagogue does - how they spend your donations**\n\nIn 2020, the United Synagogue expended approximately 33m ([Annual Report]( https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA11076376\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d242552), p. 33). This appears to be a typical year for their expenditure, which in 2019 totalled a comparable £36.5m (Annual Report, pp. 26 \u0026 44)\n\nThis expenditure went towards their goals of promoting and supporting Orthodox Judaism in the UK. Their activities include the running of religious: services; community building events; charitable outreach programs; education programs; burial services. They oversee the operation of 57 synagogues with memberships totalling 37,564 (Annual Report, p. 6).\n\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does United Synagogue compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of the United Synagogue under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\nIn 2020, the United Synagogue spent approximately £880 per practicing member (~33m spent for 37,564 members). To reach the SoGive Gold Standard Benchmark (£200 to avert one year of severe depression), the United Synagogue would have to provide a marginal improvement in well-being that is comparable to averting severe depression for over 4 years per member (880/200). We do not consider this to be realistic, and by a considerable margin.\n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the above, we rate United Synagogue as Not Recommended (Firm) under the SoGive methodology.\n"
