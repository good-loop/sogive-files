They want to bring young people together from different backgrounds, cultures and faiths, so that they can make a positive difference in their communities.

  "recommendation": "**Summary** \n\n**To evaluate The Prince’s Trust under the SoGive rating methodology, we would need more information.**\n\n- The Prince’s Trust supports young people (aged 11-30), assisting them in obtaining or furthering their education, employment and entrepreneurial skills. \n-  To this end, the Prince’s Trust has a comprehensive list of course offerings, which offer assistance for those aged 11-30, who are seeking to move into work, education or training\n-  Based on their 2019/2020 Annual Report, we estimate a cost per beneficiary of around £800. This implies that, for The Prince\u0027s Trust to be cost-effective compared to the Gold Standard, their courses would, on average, have to double their participants\u0027 consumption for around 16 years (or increase it by 50% for around 32 years etc).\n- The Prince’s Trust’s programs are likely to have some positive effects on employability, lifetime earnings, and thus, consumption. However, with the current information, it is not possible to ascertain whether this change meets or exceeds the cost-effectiveness of the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks.  \n- Information on the costs of specific programs, comprehensive impact assessments (both long and short term), and specific beneficiary figures for their smaller programmes and online programmes would enable further cost per beneficiary analysis. \n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebarl), we consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n\n**More about what The Prince’s Trust does - how they spend your donations**\n\nThe Prince’s Trust aims to help young people start businesses, get jobs, and build their confidence. To this end, The Prince’s Trust has a comprehensive list of course offerings, which offers assistance for those aged 11-30, who are seeking to move into work, education or training. The Prince’s Trust states that it has ten core programmes, as well as various local programmes and pilot programmes. Over the 2019/2020 financial year, The Prince’s Trust spent a total of £77.3m. Of this, £62.1m was charitable expenditure, and the remaining £15.1m was spent on raising funds. \n\nOut of the charitable expenditure, the vast majority of it was spent by The Prince’s Trust (UK), which expended £57.1m (approximately 92% of the total charitable expenditure), on the various aforementioned programs. Specifically, in the 2019/2020 financial year, The Prince’s Trust’s expenditure went towards providing places in courses, as enumerated below: \n- Achieve, a programme that assists young people who may be facing difficulties in the mainstream education system, or who have been excluded, is the Prince’s Trust’s largest programme in terms of participant figures. 27,223 places were provided, at a cost of £8.5m (15% of charitable expenditure in the UK). \n- Team, a \"12-week personal development programme which includes outdoor activities, work experience and a community project\", helps young people develop self-confidence and build friendships. 10,335 places were provided, requiring the expenditure of £4.7m (8%). \n- The Enterprise programme, which offers training, mentoring and grants for potential entrepreneurs, saw 9144 participants, and required expenditure of £9.9m (17%).\n- ‘Get into’ is a programme delivered in partnership with employers and training providers, which seeks to provide young people with the training and experience needed to find entry-level positions across various employment sectors. This required expenditure of £11.2m (20%), allowing for the provision of 4,931 places on the course. \n- 2,799 places were offered in Get Started (£5.1m, 9%), which consists of short courses that motivate and support young people into pursuing further education, training or employment. \n- 1,687 places were offered in the Explore programme (£7.7m, 13.5%), which is a flexible one-to-one programme tailored to the beneficiary’s individual needs, aiming to bring structure and stability to young people’s lives. \n- 5,093 grants were provided through the Development Awards (£2.9m, 5%), which assist young people in accessing education, training or employment. \n- £7.2m (13%) was spent on local programmes and pilots, which presumably include Mosaic and the Enterprise Challenge and Get Hired. Mosaic (4,369 places) is a school-based mentoring programme, which aims to improve confidence, resilience and long-term employability. The Enterprise Challenge is its associated inter-school competition. Get Hired (no participation figures available) consists of short programmes assisting youth in getting through the selection process, and into jobs. \n\nThe Prince’s Trust also provides Employability Online, which is a collection of programme resources, including \"CV writing, interview skills, and … [work] tips\". Although no participation figures for 2019/2020 are available, the 2020/2021 Impact Report states that online course delivery was critical to its impact during COVID-19; 83% of youth supported outside of the UK (around 11 thousand people) were reached via online courses and resources.  \n\nThe Prince’s Trust also has subsidiaries in America, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and an International group. However, their expenditure is relatively minor (just over 6.4% of total charitable expenditure), and much of their work, whilst likely valuable, is of a much smaller scale than its key programmes, which are located in the UK. Due to this, and the lack of clear impact reports for the subsidiaries, this analysis focuses on the UK activities of the Prince’s Trust. \n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does The Prince’s Trust compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of The Prince’s Trust, under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as doubling someone’s consumption (spending) for a year for £50, or averting one year of severe depression for £200) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. \n\nGiven the figures above, we can derive rough cost per beneficiary figures for each programme: \n- Achieve - £312 per participant\n- Team - £455 per participant \n- Enterprise - £1083 per participant \n- Get into - £2271 per participant \n- Explore - £4564 per participant \n- Get started - £1822 per participant \n- Development Awards - £569 per participant \n- Local programmes and grants - uncertain (due to lack of specific impact figures) \n\nAlternatively, using the total number of young people assisted in the UK during 2019/20 (70,181), we can come to a rough overall cost per beneficiary of £813. The cost per course place provided (72,449, accounting for young people who took part in more than one course, and those receiving ongoing support) amounts to £788. This implies that, for The Prince\u0027s Trust to be cost-effective compared to the Gold Standard of doubling consumption for £50 per year, their courses would, on average, have to double their participants\u0027 consumption for around 16 years (or increase it by 50% for around 32 years etc). Moreover (discussed in depth later), if there are economic losers, then the benefit to participants would have to be even higher. \n\nWorking out whether this meets the applicable SoGive Gold Standard benchmark is difficult, as much The Prince’s Trust’s work revolves around assisting young people into further education - deriving even rough figures for how much this increases their lifetime income by is a complex task. This is due to difficulties estimating the counterfactual (i.e. the level of educational attainment achieved without The Prince’s Trust’s work), especially since it is possible that in the absence of The Prince’s Trust, other relevant charities or institutions may have provided similar assistance. Moreover, The Prince’s Trust’s beneficiaries are likely quite heterogeneous, given the scope of its activities, and the fact that certain programs target individuals facing different levels of adversity, and thus, different probabilities of independently managing to make it into the world of work. Thus, whether The Prince’s Trust meets the Gold Standard benchmarks depends heavily upon the improvements that these programs bring to beneficiaries, over the course of their lifetimes. \n\nMoreover, we have to factor in the nonmaterial improvements that The Prince’s Trust brings to its beneficiaries - many of them face great difficulties in their lives, and so it isn’t unreasonable to assume that participation in some of these programs brings a measure of positive psychological wellbeing (ie. including potential alleviation of depression) to the participants. However, again, we have no figures by which to evaluate these emotional improvements, although glowing reviews and testimonials suggest that at least some people benefit greatly in this respect. Thus, to properly evaluate the charity, we would need more figures surrounding the lifetime income increases arising from such programme participation, and a measure of the improvement in psychological wellbeing that arises from such programmes. \n\nGiven The Prince’s Trust’s long history and generally high level of funding, it most likely has the capacity to employ economists/analysts to estimate a range of relevant outcome measures - at the very least how much they improve short-term educational outcomes or reduce short-term unemployment. As an extension on that, The Prince’s Trust could also feasibly report evidence relating to longer-term income, and perhaps even overall wellbeing. This wouldn\u0027t even have to be an analysis of their own programmes - they could draw on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and other studies done elsewhere, and demonstrate that they were implementing their programs in a similar way to those done in the studies. Given their resources, they may even have the capacity to run their own RCTs.\n\nAdmirably, The Prince’s Trust has reports which attempts to quantify some of the cumulative benefits of its programs, over the last 10 years, taking into account both direct effects and flow-on effects (ie. indirect effects that arise from the direct effects). This is estimated at £1.4 billion in value delivered to society over 10 years; extremely rudimentary maths (not accounting for the probable growth in the scale and impact of operations year-on-year) suggests that this implies at least £140m in value creation per year. However, one critical consideration is whether there are any economic losers. For example, are there people who are losing out, because they’ve lost job opportunities to people who have been aided by The Prince’s Trust’s programs? In the absolute worst case scenario, this would mean no net gain in employment and earnings across the population as a whole. This would imply that the charity\u0027s programs have zero productivity benefits. In reality, there are likely to be at least some productivity benefits, but the possibility of economic losers could effectively reduce the overall impact of the charity. With the existing information, it is not possible to ascertain with existing figures whether it is achieving outcomes comparable to the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks of effectiveness per pound donated.  \n\nFurther information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion of the work of The Prince’s Trust would be:\n(a) more comprehensive picture of the costs involved in delivering their work (eg. the cost of specific programs in the local/pilot programme section)\n(b) more comprehensive impact assessments, both in quantity and depth (the extent to which people in need have been helped, eg. lifetime income improvement, nonmaterial benefits such as mental health improvements)\n(c) more comprehensive picture about the number of people benefiting from their smaller programs, and online programs \n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTo evaluate The Prince’s Trust under the SoGive rating methodology, we would need more information.\n",
