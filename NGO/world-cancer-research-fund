  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n\n**World Cancer Research Fund is rated as Not Recommended (tentative) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- World Cancer Research Fund supports research on cancer prevention and survival, emphasising the importance of diet, weight and physical activity. The charity not only funds scientific research but also strives to translate research into easy-to-understand information and work with governments and decision-makers to influence policy. The charity belongs to [World Cancer Research Fund International](https://www.wcrf.org/), a network of research funds located in the USA, United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Hong Kong.\n- The charity reported a total expenditure of £8.8 million in 2019/20 ([2019/20 annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA11032533\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d1000739)). It’s hard to quantify the impact achieved from this spending so we can’t give a direct cost-effectiveness estimate, but for reasons detailed below, we are sceptical of the cost-effectiveness of this type of awareness-raising work, and the charity would need to supply robust evidence that their awareness-raising induces behavioural change on a significant scale, until then we rate them as Not Recommended (tentative).\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n**More about what World Cancer Research Fund does - how they spend your donations**\n\nOur main source for this section is World Cancer Research Fund’s [2019/20 annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA11032533\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d1000739),\nand their [2019/20 impact report](https://www.wcrf-uk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/WCRF-Impact-Report-2019-2020-web_0.pdf). The charity’s total expenditure was £8.8 million in 2019/20, 26% of which went to fundraising, while the remaining 74% was spent on charitable activities.\n\nContrary to its name, World Cancer Research Fund only allocated 20% of its expenditure on charitable activities to cancer research in the form of grants to university research groups. The support costs of the grant-making procedure and summarising the results in expert reports took up another 19% of charitable expenses. The funded research grants usually focus on the preventive impact of different lifestyle choices, such as determining the positive effects of following a mediterranean diet, the risks of obesity, etc. \n\nOther than research, the main focus of the charity is to provide information and education to the public about the risks or benefits of certain foods and activities in relation to cancer. This awareness-raising took up the remaining 61% of their expenditure on charitable activities. This includes interactive [websites](https://www.wcrf.org/) (for [adults](https://www.wcrf-uk.org/healthy-eating/healthy-cookbooks/) and [children](https://www.wcrf-uk.org/eat-move-learn/)), social media engagement and interviews in traditional media, an [online cookbook of healthy recipes](https://www.wcrf-uk.org/healthy-eating/healthy-cookbooks/), and outreach to health professionals and policy-makers.\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does World Cancer Research Fund compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of World Cancer Research Fund\u0027s work under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold rating, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\n*Research*\n\nThe funded [research grants](https://www.wcrf.org/research-we-fund/grant-programmes/) usually focus on the preventive impact of different lifestyle choices, such as determining the positive effects of mediterranean diet, risks of obesity, etc. You can find a list of ongoing research projects that got grants from World Cancer Research Fund in the previous years [here](https://www.wcrf.org/research-we-fund/what-we-are-funding/).\n \nWe are generally sceptical of the impact, and therefore cost-effectiveness, of this type of research, as it requires multiple steps to take effect: apart from conducting the study itself, the results must also be disseminated in a digestible format to the public and then people need to actually make lifestyle changes based on that, meaning both the physical conditions (e.g. availability of specific foods at a lower price or work conditions that allow time for the application of suncream etc) and the mental state to encourage changes needs to be provided for. For example, a new study linking physical activity to a reduced risk of various types of cancer is only useful if it convinces people to exercise more, but given there are already other studies proving a similar link and people already know that physical activity is healthy in various ways, one more study seems unlikely to change many people’s behaviour. Therefore, we believe that the marginal effect of funding an additional study in this area is probably not very high, although of course we can’t be certain of the impact of research yet to be undertaken.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that our previous [analysis](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/is-biomedical-research-good-cause-area.html?view\u003dsidebar) on cancer research suggests that compared to other research fields in public health, cancer research may be a very saturated field, and an additional pound donated to cancer research may have a smaller impact than if it were donated to research into other diseases. According to [another one of our analyses](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2017/08/donating-to-medical-research-heres-why.html) cancer research accounts for 43% of the UK\u0027s health research spending, but only 9% of the world\u0027s disease burden or 20% of the UK\u0027s disease burden. \n\n*Awareness-raising* \n\nThis point about the relatively crowded field also applies to World Cancer Research Fund’s awareness-raising work. The charity’s main communication platform, their website, received 2.7 million page views during the year, and another 3.6 million people received leaflets with health information through their door (Impact report, page 7). Some of their research was covered by the media too, although it is hard to understand what stories would have run in the absence of WCRF research, for example do popular media outlets have an internal quota of \"health stories\" to cover or is the decision to feature WCRF research solely based on \"newsworthiness\" or some other metrics. Their website mostly contains well-known advice about how to have a healthy lifestyle, and so does most of the media coverage they’ve secured. We may assume that if World Cancer Research Fund didn’t exist, then people looking for health recommendations would have found other sources. We have no reason to think that World Cancer Research Fund’s advice is more reliable than the alternative sources (like Cancer Research UK, the NHS website, WebMD or the National Cancer Institute). Additional reminders to maintain a healthy lifestyle are always useful, but as education on healthy living is part of the UK [school curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/relationships-education-relationships-and-sex-education-rse-and-health-education/physical-health-and-mental-wellbeing-primary-and-secondary) and other reminders are plentiful in the media, it is unlikely that the work of World Cancer Research Fund would have large additional effects. It’s also worth noting that the NHS also funds healthy lifestyle reminder programs, like Couch to 5k, and NICE (the National Institute of Health \u0026 Care Effectiveness) has a [threshold of spending £20,000](https://www.nice.org.uk/about/who-we-are/our-principles) per DALY (meaning they are willing to fund programs that prolong a citizen’s life for one year in perfect health for £20,000 in expectation). This is orders of magnitude higher than SoGive’s Gold Standard benchmark of £5,000 per lives saved which is around the cost-effectiveness of the best charities we know about globally. So it seems unlikely that World Cancer Research Fund could find awareness-raising programs meeting our benchmark of £5,000 per lives saved, because a program this effective would have been probably already picked up by the NHS, as it would be much cheaper than the threshold at which they are willing to fund interventions.\n\nGiven the non-program adjusted costs for World Cancer Research Funds awareness raising work in 2020 were £5.5 million, this work would need to provide benefits equivalent to saving around 1,100 lives which seems implausible given the above reasons. Therefore we rate the awareness raising program of World Cancer Research Fund’s work as not recommended.\n\nFurther information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion of the work of the World Cancer Research Fund would include:\n- An impact assessment of the charity\u0027s campaigns. What do the public and policymakers do after obtaining information from the charity? How much time do people spend on their websites per page view? What percentage of the 3.6 million leaflets distributed are actually read?\n- A comparison of the awareness-raising work done by the NHS and World Cancer Research Fund, as for a public campaign to reach our benchmark, it would need to be orders of magnitude more cost-effective than NHS’ threshold, so without further information we assume that the awareness-raising campaigns do not reach our benchmarks, otherwise the NHS would likely have already noticed these very highly cost-effective opportunities, and would have funded more campaigns in this area.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate World Cancer Research Fund as Not Recommended (tentative) under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective\n- We do have some indication of cost-effectiveness, and believe that cost-effectiveness underperforms the Gold Standard, likely by a substantial margin.",
