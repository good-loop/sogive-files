We believe this research funding to be the most promising component of their work, largely due to the fact that any scientific advances made will benefit not only those in the UK but diabetes sufferers worldwide, and in many nations the burden from diabetes is significantly increasing.\n- Overall, we believe Diabetes UK does not reach our Gold Standard for effectiveness, and likely by a substantial margin.\n\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n \nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n \n**More about what Diabetes UK does - how they spend your donations**\n \nDiabetes UK works to reduce the harm caused by diabetes to UK citizens. This involves improving treatment, managing the impact of diabetes, and prevention of the disease. They attempt to achieve these goals via interventions, advocacy, and research funding.\n\n*Expenditure*\n\nDiabetes UK spent £36.7m in 2020 (page 60 of their [annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA11144871\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d215199)). They divided this expenditure into the categories \"raising funds\" (£9.7m), \"cure or prevent\" (£9.9m), \"better care\" (£7.7m), \"living well\" (£6.8m), \"prevention\" (£2.5m) and \"remission\" (£0.1m). The interventions that come under these categories are not clearly defined in Diabetes UK’s reporting.\n \nFor SoGive analysis, we ideally divide expenditure along the lines of interventions, advocacy and research. This is due to their differing application of our [two question method]( https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar) for interventions (that aim to help individuals directly) and its derived [three question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-three-question-method-for.html?view\u003dsidebar) for advocacy or research (that aim to expedite positive systemic changes).\n \n*Research*\n\n\nWhile Diabetes UK has not provided exact research expenditure in their 2020 Annual Report, we can determine that it was between £5.9m and £7.7m (amount spent in 2020 on research within the \"cure or prevent\" category and amount spent in 2019 on research in total, respectively). Diabetes UK states that \"We are planning to restore our research investment to pre-pandemic levels in 2021\". So we can expect the expenditure going forward to be close to the pre-pandemic £7.7m figure, or roughly 30% of total expenditure on charitable activities (~7.7/27) ([2020 Annual Report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA11144871\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d215199), p.35; [2019 Annual Report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA10247736\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d215199) p.90). Furthermore, Diabetes UK’s average expenditure on research for the 10-year period leading up to March 2018 was £6.4m p/a ([Impact Report](https://diabetes-resources-production.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/resources-s3/2018-03/Diabetes%20UK%20Research%20Impact%20Report%202018.pdf), p.42).\nRegarding research output, Diabetes UK appears to fund [over 100 projects at any given time](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/research/our-research-projects). Between 2012 and 2016, Diabetes UK funded research resulted in 943 publications that have been cited 14,638 times (as of March 2018 Impact Report, p.42). An example of recent success is the [\"DiRECT trial\"](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)33102-1) in which 149 diabetes (type 2) sufferers were taken off antidiabetic drugs and put on a low-calorie diet. After 12 months, 46% (68) of these participants were in remission from the disease compared to 4% in the control group who were kept on the current best-practise care. In 2020, the NHS initiated a programme using these findings (Annual Report, p.14).\n\n*Advocacy*\n\nWe believe that expenditure allocated by Diabetes UK to \"better care\" (£7.7m) primarily covers their advocacy work. This is due to their statement that they are \"striving for better care for people living with diabetes by working with the NHS, national governments and healthcare professionals\" (Annual Report, p.35). As such, we estimate that approximately 30% (~7.7/27) of their expenditure on charitable activities goes towards advocating for change.\n\n\nRegarding advocacy successes in 2020, Diabetes UK had a role in influencing the government to introduce two pieces of legislation aimed to promote healthier eating and diabetes prevention (Annual Report, p.11). First, was a ban on junk food ads before 9pm. Second, was banning supermarkets from placing unhealthy food products in sales-boosting locations, such as at checkout; and a restriction on bulk-buy offers for unhealthy food products ([Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/28/unhealthy-snacks-to-be-banned-from-checkouts-supermarkets-in-england).\n\n*Interventions*\n\nThis leaves 40% of Diabetes UK’s charitable expenditures going towards interventions that aim to help individuals directly. In 2020, Diabetes UK states there were 8.6m users of their website. Of these users, 2m accessed Diabetes UK’s [\"Know Your Risk\" tool](https://riskscore.diabetes.org.uk/start), for preventing type 2 diabetes, and 75,000 accessed their [\"Learning Zone\" tool](https://learningzone.diabetes.org.uk/), for support and care. Furthermore, their helpline received 11,965 calls and their online events (for people with type 1 diabetes) had 493 attendees combined (Annual Report, pp.10-11).\n \n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does Diabetes UK compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n \nAfter a review of the work of Diabetes UK, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar).\n\n*Interventions*\n\nTypically, we consider it unlikely for health interventions serving UK citizens directly to be at a Gold Standard level. These charitable interventions are typically ones that the NHS have not prioritised, and the NHS consider a cost of [£20,000 to gain a year of perfect health to be cost-effective](https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg6/chapter/assessing-cost-effectiveness), which is many factors more costly than SoGive’s Gold Standard.\n\nWe estimate that 40% of Diabetes UK’s expenditure goes towards these interventions. To reach a Gold Standard level for this component of their work they would need to provide impact equivalent to saving over 2,900 lives (0.4*36.7m/5,000), or equivalent to averting 73,400 years of severe depression (0.4*36.7m/200).\n\nIn 2020, nearly 2.1m people interacted with Diabetes UK services beyond accessing the website. However, the vast majority of these people (2m) were users of Diabetes UK’s \"Know Your Risk\" prevention tool. This tool involves the user inputting age, gender, ethnicity, \"relatives with diabetes\" (y/n), waist size, height, weight, and \"high blood pressure\" (y/n) to receive a \"risk score\" and probability of obtaining diabetes in the 10 years. While the results might be informative to some users, we suspect few will be surprised by their relative risk. Scoring as \"high risk\" with the \"Know Your Risk\" tool refers the user to useful information, most notably how to register for a NHS-operated diabetes prevention programme named \"Healthier You.\" Empirical analysis to suggest the \"Know Your Risk\" tool leads to productive behavioural changes, such as registering for \"Healthier You\", is required to further analyse the effectiveness of this tool. Without this analysis, we assume this tool has a positive impact, but it is likely very negligible.\n\nWith regards to Diabetes UK’s services that assist people with diabetes (and/or their carers), in 2020 the \"Learning Zone\" tool had over 75,000 users, the phone helpline received 11,965 calls, and online events had 493 participants. We are unable to locate robust impact analysis from Diabetes UK on the effectiveness of these interventions. For the online events, 96% of those surveyed said it was a positive experience (Annual Report, p.10). However, we do not know how those surveyed were selected and it was regarding a service used by relatively few people (493 total attendees surveyed across events, and we do not know how many unique individuals there were). The \"Learning Zone\" tool is the most prolifically used service for those living with diabetes. It provides a series of courses and information packets that provide knowledge about the disease and available services, and influence dietary behaviour and physical activity. 83% of users of the \"Learning Zone\" tool reported that it provided *any* benefit to management of their diabetes (Annual Report, p.11), which we consider low for such a survey. No similar satisfaction data was provided in the Annual Report for the helpline service, which is disappointing given they received nearly 12,000 calls over the year. \n\nSo for the intervention portion of Diabetes UK’s work to reach the SoGive Gold Standard, each use of one of their services would need to provide benefits equivalent to 13 days (~73,400/365) of severe depression being averted as a result of the nearly 2.1m uses of these services. We think this is clearly unrealistic, especially when considering about 95% of the uses (2m/2.1m) are of the \"Know Your Risk\" prevention tool, which is likely considerably less impactful per use than the services for diabetes sufferers and their carers.  \n\n\n*Advocacy*\n\nIt is more plausible that Diabetes UK’s advocacy for systemic changes gets closer to our Gold Standard level. The restrictions placed on the promotion of unhealthy food probably had a positive impact. However, impact estimates are needed on the benefit of the changes. Furthermore, we are unable to locate information on Diabetes UK\u0027s role in campaigning for these changes, and this lack of publicised information is not promising. Without information on the impact of the legislation changes, and Diabetes UK’s contribution towards it, we lack sufficient reason to suspect this component of their work has historically reached our difficult Gold Standard. Further to this, a donor can expect only 30% of their donation to go towards advocacy.\n\n*Research*\n\nResearch is the component of Diabetes UK’s work that we consider to be the most promising. Medical research is often shared publicly to accelerate improvements in healthcare on a global scale (more information on our position can be found in this [blog post]( http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/is-biomedical-research-good-cause-area.html)). Globally in 2019, diabetes killed approximately 1.55m people, which was 2.74% of all deaths ([IHME](https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/), [OWID](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death)). The rate of people dying from diabetes is increasing at roughly 1.66% p/a and already as of 2019, was greater than any single type of cancer, with the exception of lung cancer. In particular, Type 2 diabetes is an increasingly significant burden in nations with less well-funded healthcare systems than the UK, meaning that any advances in the research of diabetes could have a large impact on global health burdens.(Sources [1](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-diabetes-by-type), [2](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/diabetes-prevalence?time\u003d2019), [3]( https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/diabetes), [4](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2017/08/donating-to-medical-research-heres-why.html?view\u003dsidebar)).\nThe research funded by Diabetes UK has likely advanced healthcare systems at a global level, and so will future research that they fund. However, Diabetes UK needs to provide empirical analyses of impact from the research they fund before we can ascertain if this component of their work likely gets close to reaching SoGive’s Gold Standard of cost-effectiveness. Further to this, a donor can expect only 30% of their donation to go towards research.\n\n*Overall*\n\nWe believe the cost effectiveness of donations to Diabetes UK does not reach our Gold Standard, and by a considerable margin. In part, this is due to the majority of their expenditure going to health interventions that, from a global perspective, are very cost ineffective. However, there is some promise in the work Diabetes UK does in advocacy and, especially, research.\n\nFurther information that would enable us to form a fuller opinion of the work of Diabetes UK would include:\n- A more detailed breakdown of expenditure per project.\n- Impact analysis on projects (completed and active) with regards to actual health and/or well-being measures. \n\nFor more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n \n**Conclusion**\nBased on the above, we rate Diabetes UK as Not Recommended (tentative) under the SoGive methodology. This means:\nWe do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective.\nWe do have some indication of cost-effectiveness, and believe that cost-effectiveness underperforms the Gold Standard, likely by a substantial margin.",
