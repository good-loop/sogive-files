  "recommendation": "**Summary**\n**The Al-Khair Foundation is rated as More Information Needed on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\n- Al-Khair Foundation (AKF) is a Muslim faith-based charity that works globally to provide emergency relief and developmental aid.\n- This analysis of the AKF is based on their 2020 annual report.\n- The AKF carries out numerous projects, and they are grouped into several categories. The biggest are Education, Religious dues, WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) and Humanitarian relief.\n- There is not enough information to carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis, e.g. we do not know the cost of individual projects and we do not have enough detail on the benefits of the projects.\n- Hence, we conclude that The Al-Khair Foundation is rated as More Information Needed.\n\n\n**The SoGive approach**\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-analysis-methodology.html?view\u003dsidebar), we first consider two questions:\n- How much does it cost for the charity to do something?\n- What benefit is provided (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor\u0027s money)?\n\nWe explore these questions in the next section. From this information, we then estimate the charity’s cost-effectiveness. We then compare this with the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks, which gives us an indication of how the charity compares to the most cost-effective charities we know about.\n\n\n**More about what the Al-Khair Foundation does - how they spend your donations**\n\nAKF’s [2020 annual report](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id\u003duk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet\u0026p_p_lifecycle\u003d2\u0026p_p_state\u003dmaximized\u0026p_p_mode\u003dview\u0026p_p_resource_id\u003d%2Faccounts-resource\u0026p_p_cacheability\u003dcacheLevelPage\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_objectiveId\u003dA10716441\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_mvcRenderCommandName\u003d%2Faccounts-and-annual-returns\u0026_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_priv_r_p_organisationNumber\u003d4037542) indicates that they have a large range of charitable activities. They group the activities into the following broad categories, ordered by the amount spent in 2020:\n- Education, £6,469,633, ~40%\n- Religious dues, £5,096,561, ~32%\n- WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene), £2,386,048, ~15%\n- Humanitarian relief, £1,228,001, ~8%\n- Protection and care, £355,140, ~2%\n- Rehabilitation, £207,437, ~1%\n- Healthcare, £111,493, \u003c1%\n- Economic Empowerment, £35,884, \u003c1%\n\n\nWithin each of these categories, the AKF conducts various projects. Here are some examples from their 2020 report to illustrate:\n- Education: A school in Bangladesh \"was in an urgent state of disorder and the original building was demolished\", so the AFK \"plans to rebuild the madrasah, constructing a seven storied building in place of the old one. This is intended to benefit around 2000 students.\"\n- Education and WASH: In Busia county in Kenya, the \"average number of students sharing a class in most parts of this region is around 120\" so the AFK built an extra classroom in Sio Port Muslim Primary School that accommodates approximately 70 pupils. They also built a shallow well \"which can supply more than 2,000 liters of water per day\". AFK says that \"this project benefits 900 pupils\".\n- Religious dues: \"AFK distributed Qurbani meat to people in Afghanistan, particularly those in IDP camps. In total 1500 households benefited from the Qurbani meat.\"\n- Religious dues: \"During this Ramadan in Bangladesh, many suffered from acute food shortages. AFK, to provide the people with food security at least during the month of Ramadan, distributed monthly Food Packs to 1,300 households. Furthermore, they also supplied 19,000 cooked iftar meals, 2 meals for 60 people, as well as both Sehri and Iftar, for 5000 people. There were a total of 32000 beneficiaries in this project.\"\n- Economic Empowerment: \"This year the AFK has introduced a project to help people build their careers and improve the lives of their families and thus the community. The aim is to provide a 6-month programme consisting of basic sewing and computer training to 320 unemployed impoverished youths.\"\n\nSeparate to these broad categories, the Al-Khair Foundation also runs four private schools in the UK. You can find information about these schools at the [Al-Khair Schools website](https://alkhairschool.org.uk/). In 2020, the cost of running these schools was £2,053,364, of which the vast majority (£1,759,756) is covered by the income from the fees  received, rather than charitable donations. As such, we have not considered them as part of this analysis.\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis - how does the Al-Khair Foundation compare to the most cost-effective charities?**\n\nAfter a review of the work of the AFK under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold Standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as £5,000 per life saved, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work. The process used to determine the SoGive Gold Standard benchmarks is set out [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogives-gold-standard-benchmarks.html?view\u003dsidebar). For more information on how we define our Gold, Silver, and Bronze rankings, click [here](https://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-assigns-ratings-to-charities-or.html)\n\nBased on the information available (see the examples above for illustrative examples of what information is available), we cannot directly carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis of AFK’s projects.\n\nIn order to carry out such an analysis, we would need more information, such as:\n- The cost of individual projects, rather than the total cost of a category of projects.\n- Details on the benefits of a project, e.g.:\n  - What are the benefits of building the extra room in the school in Kenya? Do more students get an education as a result, or does the education of the students who are already attending improve, or something else?\n  - What are the benefits of providing food during Ramadan? Do the individuals eat more than they otherwise would, or are they able to spend or save their income in other ways, or do they get a psychological boost from being able to participate in the religious festivals, or something else? \n  - Does the fact that food is provided only during Ramadan indicate that the people are able to feed themselves outside Ramadan?\n  - What is the total number of beneficiaries for each category of projects (rather than for specific projects within each category) and how much does the average person benefit?\n\nIdeally, any evidence of impact would be supported by a published randomized controlled trial (RCT) or other high-quality research demonstrating that the charity’s work is of significant positive impact. This evidence could come from a trial of the charity’s specific projects, but the charity could also simply demonstrate they are implementing their projects in a manner that is consistent with other projects that have already been evaluated as part of a RCT or other robust approach. Given the current allocation of spending across categories, the priority should be for evidence relating to their Education, Religious dues, and WASH projects. \n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate the Al-Khair Foundation as More Information Needed under the SoGive methodology.\n",
